This is in particular the case for {UML} 2.0 state machines, which are widely used for modeling the reactive behavior of objects. In this paper, a list of 29 newly detected trouble spots consisting of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and unnecessarily strong restrictions of {UML} 2.0 state machines is given and illustrated using 6 state machines having a problematic meaning; suggestions for improvement are presented. In particular, we show that the concepts of history, priority, and entry/exit points have to be reconsidered.},
