\subsubsection{Consideration of hardware and software constraints}



Hardware design is out of scope of the openETCS project. 
No hardware assumptions have been formulated so far.

\noindent 
Software constraints encompass:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Constraints by the software design method. 
         The design should rely on
   \begin{itemize}
   \item modelling
   \item a modular approach
   \item defensive programming
   \end{itemize}

   \item Restrictions implied by the coding standards.
         The coding standard should include
   \begin{itemize}
   \item a coding style guide
   \item restrict the use of pointers, dynamic objects, recursion and global variables
   \end{itemize}

   \item Constraints on timing, performance, or memory of  individual modules.
   \item constraints implied by 
         the interfacing system (e.g. decoder and encoder functions)
   \item the operating system
\end{enumerate}
