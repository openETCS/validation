\subsubsection{Verification of the openETCS Architecture and Design Specification}
\label{sec:}

\paragraph{Contributing project partners}
This work has been performed by the DLR.

\paragraph{Process step}
This activity is part of the verification of the openETCS SW
Architecture and Design Specification (4-19), ADD. It contributes to the SW
Design Verification Report (4-23).

\paragraph{Object of verification}
The object of verification is D3.5.3, the openETCS Architecture and
Design Specification.

\paragraph{Available specification}
The ADD is checked against
Subset~026 \cite{subset-026:3.3.0}.

\paragraph{Objective}
The objective is to check that the procedures of ETCS OBU are completely,
correctly and consistently mapped to the components of the SW as
described in the ADD document.

\paragraph{Method/Approach}
The verification has been performed by comparing the corresponding
specifications of Subset~026 with the ADD document for each relevant
paragraph.

\paragraph{Means/Tools}
The verification has been performed manually.

\paragraph{Results}
The verification uncovered some minor inconsistencies. These have been
reported to be removed in D3.5.4 which revises D3.5.3.
