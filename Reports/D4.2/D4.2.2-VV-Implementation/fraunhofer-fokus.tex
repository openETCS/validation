\section{Formal Verification of Bitwalker}
\label{sec:fokus}


In this section we describe our work on the formal verification
of the so-called Bitwalker.
The Bitwalker shall read bit sequences from a bit stream 
and convert them to an integer. Furthermore, it shall
convert an integer into a bit sequence and write it into a bit stream.
Therefore, the Bitwalker has a read and a write function, namely \peek and \poke.

Our aim is to verify the functionality of
\peek and \poke
as well as their correct interaction.
Furthermore, we want to verify some robustness cases for \peek and \poke
and the absence of run time errors for both functions.
We won't take into account any complexity requirements.

We introduce a method to achieve these goals in section~\ref{plan}.
Moreover, it is our intention
to elaborate the method and in particular the associated tools.

Subsequently, we use the method for \peek and \poke
in section~\ref{peek} and~\ref{poke}, respectively.
We provide an informal specification, an implementation and
a formal specification for each function and
present what could have been verified for the implementation.

We discuss the interaction of these functions in section~\ref{interaction}
where we show how the interaction can be formally specified 
and present the verification results.
Finally, we give an overview about the still open issues in section~\ref{issues}.


\subsection{Verification Method}
\label{plan}
\label{method}

In this section we introduce our method of choice along with the used tools.
We use a deductive verification approach to 
formally prove that a function fulfills its specification.
The foundations for deductive verification are axiomatic semantics as formulated
by Hoare~\cite{HoareCalculus}.
Figure~\ref{fig:method} shows the method with the involved verification tools.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{figures/method-bitwalker.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:method} The method to formally verify the Bitwalker.}
\end{figure}

Starting point is an informal specification of a function with which in mind
a implementation is written and on which basis the formal specification is created.
The formal specification of a function is a so-called function contract
which contains preconditions to express what a function expects from its caller
and postconditions to state the guarantees after the execution.
The specification language is called 
\acsl (ANSI\slash ISO-\isoc Specification Language)~\cite{acsl} 
which is a formal language to express behavioral properties of \isoc programs.

Moreover, it is the specification language associated with 
the verification platform \framac~\cite{FramaC}
which we use along with its plug-in \wpframac~\cite{wp}.
Within \framac, \wpframac enables the deductive verification of
\isoc programs that have been annotated with \acsl.
\wpframac generates verification conditions which are submitted to external 
automatic or interactive theorem provers.
A function is then verified if each verification condition is discharged
by at least one prover.

Figure~\ref{fig:method} shows that we first apply the automatic
theorem provers \altergo~\cite{alt-ergo} and \cvc~\cite{cvc3}
and then apply the
interactive theorem prover \coq~\cite{Coq}
for the still unproven conditions in order to automate as much as possible.
Moreover, unproven conditions motivate to give some extra information
in the form of axioms, lemmas and assertions in \acsl, 
since they can ease the search of a proof.
One need to be careful with axioms because they can yield contradictions
and thus make the proof system unsound.
This is different for lemmas and assertions
because \wpframac will generate additional verification conditions for them.

In order to prove the absence of run time errors we use
the \inl{rte} option of \wpframac that automatically introduces \acsl
assertions. If all these assertions can be proven, then
the absence of run time errors is guaranteed.


\begin{framed}
The verifiers received the source code without sufficiently clear explanation
about how the inputs and outputs of bitwalker functions are related.
In particular, no information about error conditions were provided.
On such a basis it is, as pointed out on Page~\pageref{lesson},
not possible to write meaningful test cases;
let alone to formally verify the functionality of the bitwalker functions.

In a first step, we therefore inspected the source code and 
derived from this an \emph{informal specification}.
This informal specification is to be understood
as a requirements document for the bitwalker functions as it should have been
available for both the programmer and the verifier.

There are several problems with this approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The verifier could make an error while analysing the source code
and end up with a wrong specification. 
In fact, this happened in a first version.

\item
There could also be an error in the implementation which would then be present also
in the specification, thus leading to the claim ``the code works as implemented''.
\end{itemize}

In order to avoid these problems we submitted our informal specification
for review by the domain experts.
\end{framed}

\subsection{A First Look on \peek}

Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} shows the original implementation of \peek.


\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Original/Bitwalker_peek.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:peek-original} Original implementation of \peek}
\end{listing}

Here are some remarks on this implementation.

\begin{itemize}
\item The implementation extensively uses bit operations.
      This is of course largely a matter of taste.
      Nevertheless, it is questionable whether representing a division 
      of an index~\inl{i} by~8 as \inl{i >> 3} is better than writing it as~\inl{i/8}.
\item The argument \inl{Bitstream} represents an array that is only read.
      It is good programming practice to qualify such arguments as \inl{const}.

\item The cast of \inl{CurrentValue != 0} to \inl{uint8_t} is unnecessary for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item The result of expression \inl{CurrentValue != 0} is of type \inl{int} and has either the value~1 or~0.
\item According to the ``usual arithmetic conversions''\footnote{%
     This is indeed the heading of Section~6.3.1.8 of the C standard.
}
this value will be promoted to the type of \inl{retval << 1} which is~\inl{uint64_t}.
\end{itemize}

    Thus, the cast to \inl{uint8_t} is pointless and removing it increases the clarity of the code.

\end{itemize}

\clearpage
At one point, an alternative to the implementation of \peek in
Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} was suggested.
This alternative implementation, which is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:peek-alternative}
attempts to limit the use of bit operations to a minimum.


\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=acsl-block,frame=single]
  uint64_t Bitwalker_Peek (unsigned int Startposition,
                           unsigned int Length,
                           uint8_t Bitstream[],
                           unsigned int BitstreamSizeInBytes)
  {
    uint64_t retval = 0;
    for (unsigned int i = Startposition +
           BitstreamSizeInBytes*!((Startposition + Length) <=
           BitstreamSizeInBytes*8);
           i < Startposition + Length; i++)
      retval = (retval*2) +
               (uint8_t)((uint8_t)!!(Bitstream[i/8] & BitwalkerBitMaskTable[i%8]));
    return retval;
 }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:peek-alternative} An alternative implementation of \peek}
\end{listing}

Interestingly, this implementation also employs unnecessary casts to \inl{uint8_t}.
However, the real problem with this alternative implementation is that it produces
different results: Calling \peek from Listing~\ref{lst:peek-original} with the arguments

\begin{verbatim}
  Startposition = 8
  Length = 32
  Bitstream[] = {254, 7, 13, 9}
  BitstreamSizeInBytes = 4
\end{verbatim}

produces~0 whereas the implementation from Listing~\ref{lst:peek-alternative} returns~118294784.
Apparently, even \peek is not so simple that its functionality can be unambiguously
understood just by looking at the code.


\clearpage

Figure~\ref{fig:peek-wp} shows a normalized representation of \peek
that is enhanced with static \acsl assertions.
These assertions can be generated by \framac for all operations where
runtime errors, that is illegal pointer accesses or arithmetic overflows, can occur.
Green bullets indicate potential runtime errors where \framacwp can verify
that they will \emph{not} occur.


\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/peek-wp.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:peek-wp} Potential runtime errors in \peek}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

These potential runtime errors are related to the facts that at this point \framacwp
\begin{itemize}
\item cannot exclude that \inl{Length} can be greater then~64 
\item has to assume that \inl{Startposition + Length} may overflow
\item has no guarantee that \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length 
      of the array starting at the address \inl{Bitstream}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsection{A First Look on \poke}

Listing~\ref{lst:poke-original} shows the original implementation of \poke.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./Bitwalker/Original/Bitwalker_poke.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{lst:poke-original} Original implementation of \poke}
\end{listing}

Clearly visible in the code are various error conditions that are checked 
returned by~\poke.
No specifications for these error conditions have been provided.
 
\clearpage


Figure~\ref{fig:poke-wp} shows the normalized representation of \poke
with \acsl assertions that indicate potential runtime erros.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/poke-wp.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:poke-wp} Potential runtime errors in \peek}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Similiarly to the potential runtime errors of \peek \framacwp
faces the problem that it

\begin{itemize}
\item cannot exclude that \inl{Length} can be greater then~64 
\item has to assume that \inl{Startposition + Length} may overflow
\item has no guarantee that \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length 
      of the array starting at the address \inl{Bitstream}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsection{Informal Specifications}


Before we introduce some auxiliary concepts and formulate general assumptions
we would like to point our a the following: 
When we speak of \emph{integers}, then we refer to the infinite set of mathematical
integers $\{\ldots, -1, 0, 1, \ldots\}$
and not one of the many finite representation provided by the type system of~C.

\begin{itemize}
\item
A \emph{bit stream} is an array containing elements of type \verb"uint8_t".

A bit stream of length $n$ contains $8n$ bits.

\item
A bit stream is \emph{valid} if the array is valid.

\item 
A bit stream can be indexed both by its array indices
and its \emph{bit indices}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bitstream-indices} shows the difference between 
array indices and bit indices in a bit stream.
The two bit indices, 0~and~14,
mark bit positions in the first and second array element, respectively.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{figures/array_as_stream.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:bitstream-indices} Array indices and bit indices in a bit stream}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\item
A \emph{bit sequence} is a consecutive sequence of bits within a bit stream
as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:bitsequence}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{figures/bit_sequence.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:bitsequence} A bit sequence within a bit stream}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A bit sequence is given by the position of its first bit (a bit index in the bit stream)
and its \emph{length}, that is, the number of bits it contains.

\item A bit sequence of length $l$ that starts at bit index $p$ is \emph{valid}
     with respect to a bit stream of length $n$ if the following conditions are
     satisfied
     \begin{align*}
         0 &\leq p < 8n \\
         0 &\leq p + l < 8n
     \end{align*}

\item 
We assume that the C-types \inl{unsigned int} and \inl{int}, which
are used in the implementation to represent indices, counting and error codes,
have a width of~32~bits.
We point this out here because we conducted the verification on a platform with
these characteristics.

As an aside, MISRA-C discourages the use of ``generic'' integer types
such as \inl{int} and \inl{unsigned int} and recommends the use of integer types whose names
contain the exact width.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Informal Specification of \peek}
\label{informal-peek}

Now we specify \peek with the introduced auxiliary concepts.
The function \peek reads a bit sequence from a bit stream
and converts it to an integer.

Its function signature reads as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=acsl-block]
uint64_t  Bitwalker_Peek(unsigned int Startposition, 
                         unsigned int Length,
                         uint8_t Bitstream[],
                         unsigned int BitstreamSizeInBytes);
\end{lstlisting}

The arguments have the following purpose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \inl{Startposition} is the bit index in the bit stream 
    where the bit sequence starts.
    \item \inl{Length} is the length of the bit sequence.
    \item \inl{Bitstream} is the array which provides the bit stream.
    \item \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length of the array 
    containing the bit stream. 
\end{itemize}

The following preconditions shall hold for the function arguments.
Note that additional constraints are implicitly expressed by the use
of \emph{unsigned} integer types.

\begin{itemize}
\item \inl{Bitstream} is a valid array of length \verb"BitstreamSizeInBytes"

\item \inl{Length} $\leq$ \inl{64} and

\item \inl{Startposition + Length} $\leq$ \inl{UINT_MAX}.\footnote{%
      One of the reviewer had difficulties to understand this requirement.
      If \inl{Startposition + Length} were (as an integer value) greater
      than \inl{UINT_MAX}, then the result would be represented as a value of
      \inl{unsigned int} that might be less than \inl{Startposition}.
      Thus, the range \inl{Startposition ... Startposition + Length} would be
      empty which is in most cases not what the programmer wanted.
      This is a common mistake in programs and sometimes exploited by attackers.
}
\end{itemize}

We continue with a more precise description of the desired behavior of \peek.
As mentioned, the function \texttt{Bitwalker\_Peek} reads a bit sequence from a bit stream
and converts it to a 64-bit unsigned integer.

For a bit sequence $(b_0, b_1,\ldots,b_{n - 1})$ the function \peek returns the sum
\begin{align}
    b_0 \cdot 2^{n - 1} + b_1\cdot 2^{n - 2} + \ldots + b_{n-1}\cdot 2^0
    =
    \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i \cdot 2^{(n - 1) - i} 
\end{align}

Note that is a higher-level description than what is done in the source code.
There is, in our opinion, not much point to reflect low-level bit fiddling
into the specification if a clearer description is at hand.

If the bit sequence is not valid, then \peek shall return~0.
We were wondering why the implementation maps an illegal input to a legitimate output.
The code providers argued along the lines that this error condition was not
considered important enough to be properly reported.
One can interpret this design decision as an attempt to increase the
robustness of the function against illegal values.
In general, we recommend to explicitly describe all error conditions
and to devise a consistent error detection and error recovery strategy.


\subsubsection{Informal Specification of \poke}
\label{informal-poke}

In this section we examine the function \poke
in the same manner as we did it for \peek in section~\ref{peek}.

The function \poke converts an integer to a bit sequence and writes it
into a bit stream.
Its function signature reads as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style = acsl-block]
int      Bitwalker_Poke(unsigned int Startposition,
                        unsigned int Length,
                        uint8_t Bitstream[],
                        unsigned int BitstreamSizeInBytes,
                        uint64_t Value);
\end{lstlisting}


%\subsubsection*{Arguments}
The arguments have the following purpose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Startposition} is the bit index in the bit stream 
    where the bit sequence starts.
    \item \texttt{Length} is the length of the bit sequence.
    \item \texttt{Bitstream} is the array which provides the bit stream.
    \item \texttt{BitstreamSizeInBytes} is the length of the array 
    containing the bit stream. 
    \item \texttt{Value} is the integer which shall be converted into a bit sequence.
\end{itemize}


%\subsubsection*{Preconditions}
The following preconditions shall hold for the function arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Bitstream} is a valid array of length \verb"BitstreamSizeInBytes"

\item \texttt{Length} $<$ \texttt{unsigned int}.

\item \texttt{Startposition + Length} $\leq$ \verb"UINT_MAX".
\end{itemize}

Note that additional constraints are implicitly expressed by the use
of \emph{unsigned} integer types.


%\subsubsection*{Description}
Now we can specify \poke as follows:
The function \poke converts a 64-bit unsigned integer to a bit sequence and 
writes it into a bit stream.

For $0 \leq x$ exists a shortest sequence of~0 and~1
$(b_0, b_1,\ldots,b_{n - 1})$
such that
\begin{align}
    \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i \cdot 2^{(n - 1) - i} = x.
\end{align}

The function \poke tries to store the sequence $(b_0, b_1,\ldots,b_{n - 1})$
in the bit sequence of \texttt{Length} bits that starts
at bit index \texttt{Startposition}.

The return value of \poke depends on the following three cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
If the bit sequence is valid, then there are two cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
If $\texttt{Length} \geq n$, then  the sequence
$(\overbrace{0,\ldots,0}^{\texttt{Length}-n},b_0, b_1,\ldots,b_{n - 1})$
is stored in the bit stream starting at \texttt{Startposition}.
The return value of \poke is 0.

\item
If $\texttt{Length} < n$, then the
sequence $(b_0, b_1,\ldots,b_{n - 1})$ cannot be stored and\\
\poke returns~$-2$.
\end{itemize}

\item 
If the bit sequence is not valid, then \poke returns~$-1$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formal Specification with \acsl}
\label{formal-peek}

In order to verify that the given implementation of \peek fulfills 
the informal specification, we have to formalize the specification.
Listing~\ref{fig:spec-peek} shows such a formalization in \acsl for \peek.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./figures/peek.spec}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{fig:spec-peek} Formal specification of \peek in \acsl}
\end{listing}

We specify a function contract for \peek containing preconditions
and postconditions introduced by the key words \inl{requires}
and \inl{ensures}, respectively.
In addition, the \acsl language provides the \inl{assigns} clause to specify 
that a function is not allowed to change memory locations other than the ones 
explicitly listed. 
When no \inl{assigns} clauses are specified, 
the function is allowed to modify every accessible memory location. 

The three preconditions for the function arguments of the informal specification 
are formalized straight forward in the function contract also by three preconditions.
For the first one we use the predicate \inl{IsValidRange}
which we specified in \acsl in order to state that the \inl{Bitstream}
is a valid array of length \inl{BitstreamSizeInBytes}.
Furthermore, we claim {\it via} the \inl{assigns} clause 
that \peek does not alter any memory location
apart from local variables.

Moreover, we use so-called behaviors in \acsl for a distinction of the two cases
from the informal specification.
The cases are discriminated through the predicate \texttt{ValidBitIndex}
which indicates whether a bit sequence is valid or not.
The first behavior \texttt{out\_of\_range} represents the robustness 
case where the bit sequence is not valid and 
the second behavior specifies the expected behavior in the normal case.

In both cases we state what the result of \peek shall be 
as postconditions. In addition, we use a negated form of
a predicate called \inl{TooBig} in the last postcondition of
the normal case. This postcondition was introduced to verify
that the functions \peek and \poke interact correctly.
Therefore, we will discuss this postcondition in section~\ref{interaction}.

Since the implementation of \peek contains a loop,
we need a loop specification containing a variant for the termination
proof and some invariants to enable the automatic theorem provers
to verify the postconditions.
Although this loop specification is important for the verification,
it is not used for formalizing the informal specification.

Since we verify the implementation with respect to the formal specification, 
it is crucial that it matches the informal one. 
Therefore, we reviewed the accordance of both specifications.

\subsubsection{Formal Specification of \poke with ACSL}
\label{formal-poke}

Listing~\ref{fig:spec-poke} shows the function contract of \poke.
The case independent preconditions of the informal specification 
are reflected by the  first three \inl{requires}-clauses at the beginning of the contract.
\poke modifies the \inl{Bitstream} and reads the array
\inl{BitwalkerBitMaskTable} thus we need to express 
that the two arrays must have separated memory locations. 
Therefore, we use the predicate \inl{separated} in the fourth \inl{requires}-clause.
Furthermore, in the following \inl{assigns}-clause we specify the memory locations which 
can be altered by the function.

We specify the three cases of \poke by using behaviors. 
The first behavior \inl{out\_of\_range} occurs if the given bit sequence is not valid with respect to the \inl{Bitstream}. 
The second behavior \inl{value\_too\_big} covers the case where the value \inl{Value} 
is not representable with only \inl{Length} bits.

Finally, the behavior \inl{normal} assumes 
that \inl{Value} is not too big and the bit sequence is valid. 
Here, \poke writes the particular bit sequence into \inl{Bitstream} 
while all other memory locations are unaltered.
For all behaviors there is one postcondition to state what
the return value shall be in this case.

\subsection{Formal Verification with \framacwp}
\label{verification-peek}

In this section we present the current state of the verification results 
for \peek.
Table~\ref{tab:results-peek} discriminates the results for
three different types of verification conditions (VCs).

\begin{table}[hbt]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}[htb]{lccc}
    \toprule

%    &$27$&$22$&$81$\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Verification Results of \peek}
  \label{tab:results-peek}
\end{table}


The first row contains the lemmas we used to ease the verification for the automatic theorem provers.
The second row contains the \inl{rte}-assertions 
concerning the absence of run time errors.
The third row shows all other verification conditions for \peek
which are mainly about functional behavior.
However, they also contain the postconditions for the robustness cases
and the loop specification.

For each row we listed the total number of generated verification conditions,
the number of proven verification conditions and the verification rate
that is the percentage of proven verification conditions. 

The verification rate for the \inl{rte}-assertions are very low 
due to the difficulty for \framac to deal with bit operations.
In order to increase this rate, we will verify the absence
of run time errors separately and will provide additional lemmas and axioms
to ease the verification.
We point out some of the related challenges in section~\ref{issues}.

\subsubsection{Formal Verification with Frama-C/WP}

In this section we present the current state of verification results of 
for \poke.
The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:results-poke}.
 We listed the different verification conditions 
 row by row like we did for \peek.

The function \poke has significantly more unproven verification conditions than \peek
this is because it is more complex and alters memory locations via bit operations.
Therefore, we will verify the absence of run time errors separately as well.

\subsection{Interaction of \peek and \poke}
\label{interaction}


In this section we examine the interaction of 
\peek and \poke. The functions shall be inverse to each other
with respect to the normal cases of both functions.
In the following we provide a formal specification and present
our verification results.


\subsubsection{Formal Specification with ACSL and C}

For the specification of the interaction we have two auxiliary \isoc functions:
The first one to call first \poke on a bit stream and then \peek
and the second one to do it the other way around.

Figure~\ref{fig:poke-peek} shows the straightforward implementation 
of the first helper function along with its \acsl contract.
The contract contains a lot of preconditions because we
only specify an interaction for the case where both 
functions are called in their normal
cases. The reader can compare the preconditions with the ones from
the contracts of \peek and \poke with respect to the \inl{normal} behaviors.
As a postcondition we formulate that \peek reads exactly the value
written by \poke.

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single, linerange=3-20]{./figures/Peek_Poke_inverse.c}
\end{minipage}
\caption{\label{fig:poke-peek} Specification of interaction when first calling \poke.}
\end{listing}

Figure~\ref{fig:peek-poke} shows the straightforward implementation 
of the second auxiliary function along with its \acsl contract.
In contrast to the first function, we work with two bit streams.
With \peek a certain bit sequence is read out from one bit stream
and written via \poke into the other one.
Therefore, we formulate as a postconditions that
the two bit streams are equal in these certain ranges.

\subsubsection{Formal Verification with Frama-C/WP}

All postconditions (and the assertion in figure~\ref{fig:peek-poke})
are verified. Therefore, we succeeded to prove that the 
functions \peek and \poke interact correctly
with respect to their specifications.

Moreover, this verification result serves as a validation for the contracts
of \peek and \poke because verification of the interaction 
depends on these contracts. Since both functions are called,
the caller has to ensure that all preconditions hold
and can then rely on the guarantees given by the postconditions.

As a remark, we extended the contract of \peek by one postcondition 
to ease the verification of the interaction.
The postcondition simply states that the read value is always representable 
by \inl{Length} bits which is obviously always the case,
since the value is the sum of \inl{Length} bits.
The postcondition is needed to ensure that the preconditions for the normal case
of \poke are fulfilled when first calling \peek and then \poke.

\subsection{Open Issues}
\label{issues}


We have seen in this section that \wpframac currently does not deal very well with bit operations.
This is due to the fact that \wpframac's memory models do not provide 
much information about bit operations.
As a consequence, the provers have few options to manipulate the proof goal.
This problem is known and \cealist is working on a solution for the next release of \wpframac.

As a workaround one could introduce axioms which provide
additional facts about bit operations. 
The problem with using axioms is that one can easily introduce wrong facts
which lead to contradictions making the whole proof system unsound. 
Thus, this approach requires a careful review of the added axioms.

Moreover, the chosen automatic theorem provers are generally not very
good when it comes to mixing arithmetic and bit operations.
There is, however, an automatic theorem prover, namely \z,
which can handle arithmetic and bit operations, using a specific syntax.
\framac's interface for \z does not currently takes advantage of this, 
but this may change in a future release.
We therefore expect a better automatic verification rate for the verification of BitWalker.

Another approach to deal with unproven verification conditions consists in
applying an \emph{interactive theorem prover} such as \coq.
Using \coq's rich support for proof manipulation would certainly be very helpful
for the discharge of more proof obligations.
