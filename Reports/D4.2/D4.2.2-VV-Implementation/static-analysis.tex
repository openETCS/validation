\label{sec:static-analysis}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we describe our work on the static code analysis of the bitwalker code provided in \href{https://github.com/openETCS/validation/tree/master/Artifacts/Subset-026-7_XML/Subset026_7/Bitwalker}{[validation repository]}

Our aim is to discover programing errors, obtain code metrics (lines of code, lines of code/lines of comments, cyclomatic complexity, Halsted metrics, class inherance tree and others) and verify the C11 standard and some subset of rules defined in the MISRA C Standard. That is, we focus on the different aspects of the source code to ensure the quality of the code in various perspectives.

The code metrics help understanding the complexity of the code and can lead to code changes. The complexity metrics allows us to identify particularly complex program areas that it would be desirable to redesign, and where problems that will appear in the maintenance phase are likely focused. For example, the cyclomatic complexity or the number of paths, is a software quality metric that quantifies the complexity of a program and also indicates the number of test cases that would have to be written to execute all paths in a program. However, the cyclomatic complexity only considers the decision structure of a program, not consider the complexity of nesting. There are more complexity metrics that takes into account the degree of nesting of a program or that consider the volumen and the program level like the Halsted metrics. The conjunction of the complexity metrics are an important indicator of the code readability, maintainability and portability, and the more complex the code is, more likely it will contain masked bugs.

CENELEC Standard identifies techniques and measures for 5 levels of software safety integrity and requires the use of a package of techniques and their correct
application appropriate to the software safety integrity level.

Six different static analysis tools have been used during the code verification activities in order to assess the quality of the results, ensure code quality and cover different techniques and metrics high recommended by CENELEC Standard. The selected tools are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Resource Standard Metrics (\href{http://msquaredtechnologies.com/m2rsm/}{RSM})}: a source code metrics and quality analysis tool
\item \textbf{\href{http://www.locmetrics.com/}{LocMetrics}}: a simple tool for counting lines of code in C\#, Java, and C++
\item \textbf{\href{http://www.scitools.com/}{Understand}}: a reverse engineering, documentation and metrics tool for C and C++ source code. It offers code navigation using a detailed cross reference, a syntax colorizing "smart" editor, and a variety of graphical reverse engineering views.                          
\item \textbf{\href{http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/}{Clang Static Analyzer}}: The Clang Static Analyzer consists of both a source code analysis framework and a standalone tool that finds bugs in C and Objective-C programs.
\item \textbf{\href{http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/}{CPPcheck}}: a static analysis tool for C, C++ code. Unlike C, C++ compilers and many other analysis tools it does not detect syntax errors in the code. Cppcheck primarily detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally do not detect. 
\item \textbf{\href{http://www.verifysoft.com/en_cmtx.html}{Testwell CMT++}}: Based on the static properties of the program code CMT++ gives estimates how error prone the program source code is due to its complexity, how long it will take to understand the code, what is the logical volume of the code, etc ...
\end{itemize}


Finally, according to the results obtained by using the tools, we will present some conclusions.

\section{Resource Standard Metrics -RSM- Results}
In this section we provide the results obtained with the \href{http://msquaredtechnologies.com/m2rsm/}{[RSM]} tool.

Resource Standard Metrics (RSM) is a source code metrics and quality analysis tool. This tool provides standard metrics and a combination of features that allow to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze source code for programming errors
\item Analyze source code for code style enforcement
\item Create an Inheritance tree from the code
\item Collect Source Code Metrics by the function, class, file, and project
\item Analyze Cyclomatic Complexity
\end{itemize}

Besides, RSM has intrinsic quality notices, can be extended by the end user with User Defined Quality Notices using regular expressions to analyze code lines and it is mapped to the MISRA C Standard. 

RSM has been customized to obtain the below metrics and analysis and the corresponding reports that are available into the \href{https://github.com/openETCS/validation/tree/master/VnVUserStories/VnVUserStorySQS/04-Results}{[VnVUserStories folder]}

\begin{itemize}
\item Project Functional Metrics and Analysis
\item Project Class/Struct Metrics and Analysis
\item Class Inheritance Tree
\item Project Quality Profile
\item Quality Notice Density
\item Files Keywords and Metrics
\item Project Keywords and Metrics
\item Files Function Metrics
\item Class/Struct Metrics
\item Complexity Metrics
\end{itemize}

As mentioned previously CENELEC Standard requires the use of a package of techniques. With the use of the RSM tool the following Cenelec Standard techniques have been covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limited Size and Complexity in Functions, Subroutines and Methods (High Recommended)
\item Coding Standard (Mandatory): At this point the fulfillment of some of the MISRA-C Standard rules has been checked.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality Metrics}

As well as having intrinsic and user definied quality notices, RSM tool is mapped to the MISRA C Industry Standard. Taking into account the intrisic quality notice and the user defined quality notices the RSM tool covers 40.16\% of \href{http://msquaredtechnologies.com/m2rsm/docs/QualityStandards/MISRA_C_Mapping.htm}{[MISRA C]} rules.

The following table shows the intrinsic Quality Notices for C language that RSM tool checks.

{\footnotesize\sffamily\centering
  \begin{longtable}{||p{.45\textwidth}|p{.5\textwidth}||}
  \caption{Quality Notices}\\
    \hline\hline
    \hline\hline
    \endhead
    \hline\hline
    \endfoot
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 1}

Emit a quality notice when the physical line length is greater than the specified number of characters.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Reproducing source code on devices that are limited to 80 columns of text can cause the truncation of the line or wrap the line.  Wrapped source lines are difficult to read, thus creating weaker peer reviews of the source code}.
& \textbf{Quality Notice No. 2}

Emit a quality notice when the function name length is greater than the specified number of characters.  

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Long function names may be a portability issue especially when code has to be cross compiled onto embedded platforms.  This difficultly is typically seen with older hardware and operating systems.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 3}
    
Emit a quality notice when ellipsis '...' are identified within a functions parameter list thus enabling variable arguments.  

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Ellipsis create a variable argument list.  This type of design is found in C and C++.  It essentially breaks the type strict nature of C++ and should be avoided.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 4}
 
Emit a quality notice if there exists an assignment
operator '=' within a logical 'if' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An assignment within an "if" condition is likely a typographical error giving rise to a logic defect.  However, some programmers place compound statements into the "if" condition making the code difficult to read.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 5}
    
Emit a quality notice if there exists an assignment
operator '=' within a logical 'while' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An assignment within a "while" condition is likely a typographical error giving rise to a logic defect.  However, some programmers place compound statements into the "while" condition making the code difficult to read.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 6}
 
Emit a quality notice when a pre-decrement operator '--' is identified within the code.  

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ The pre-decrement of a variable occurs before the remainder of the processing in the statement.  This can be difficult to comprehend or anticipate.  There are documented cases where the mathematical results vary between the result of macros when different code preprocessors expand the macros into a normal form.  Remember, there is no standard for the preprocessor, just the language.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 7}
    
Emit a quality notice when a pre-increment operator '++' is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The pre-increment of a variable occurs before the remainder of the processing in the statement.  This can be difficult to comprehend or anticipate.  There are documented cases where the mathematical results vary between the result of macros when different code preprocessors expand the macros into a normal form.}  
& \textbf{Quality Notice No. 8}

Emit a quality notice when the 'realloc' function
is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Using realloc can lead to latent memory leaks within your C or C++ code.  The call to realloc reassigns the pointer to the same memory address using a larger or smaller space.  However if realloc fails, a NULL pointer is returned.  No "free" was performed on the pointer so if you don't retain the pointer before the realloc call, a latent memory leak could occur.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 9}
    
Emit a quality notice when the 'goto' function
is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The use of "goto" creates spaghetti code.  A "goto" can jump anywhere to the destination label.  This type of design breaks the "one in - one out" ideal of a function creating code which can be impossible to debug or maintain.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 10}
 
Emit a quality notice when the Non-ANSI function prototype is identified within the code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Older C code can be written in a style that does not use function prototypes of the function argument types.  This code will not compile on ANSI C and C++ compilers because of this type of weakness.  Identifying this condition can help assess whether code can be ported to a newer version of the language.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 11}
    
Emit a quality notice when open and closed brackets '[ ]' are not balance within a file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{This type of error is always caught by the compiler as a syntax error.  However, a compiler can be told to ignore source code by using preprocessor directives like \#if ... \#endif.  This is a way to "comment" out large blocks of code.  However, the code still looks like operational code to the maintainer as it is not a comment.  Many hours can be wasted working on dead code.  This quality notice serves to warn you of this dead code that should be removed or converted to actual comment form.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 12}
 
Emit a quality notice when open and closed parenthesis '( )' are not balance within a file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{This type of error is always caught by the compiler as a syntax error.  However, a compiler can be told to ignore source code by using preprocessor directives like \#if ... \#endif.  This is a way to "comment" out large blocks of code.  However, the code still looks like operational code to the maintainer as it is not a comment.  Many hours can be wasted working on dead code.  This quality notice serves to warn you of this dead code that should be removed or converted to actual comment form.}.
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 13}
    
Emit a quality notice when a 'switch' statement does not have a 'default' condition.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A "switch" statement must always have a default condition or this logic construct is non-deterministic.  Generally the default condition should warn the user of an anomalous condition which was not anticipated by the programmer by the case clauses of the switch.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 14}
 
Emit a quality notice when there are more 'case' conditions than 'break', 'return' or 'fall through' comments.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Many tools, including RSM, watch the use of "case" and "break" to ensure that there is not an inadvertent fall through to the next case statement.  RSM requires the programmer to explicitly indicate in the source code via a "fall through" comment that the case was designed to fall through to the next statement.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 16}
    
Emit a quality notice when function white space
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Source code must be easily read.  A low percentage of white space indicates that the source code is crammed together thus compromising the readability of the code.  Typically white space less than 10 percent is considered crammed  code. }
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 17}
 
Emit a quality notice when function comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.  However, the content quality of the comment is just as important as the quantity of the comments.  For this reason you could use the -E option to extract all the comments from a file.  The reviewer should be able to read the comments and extract the story of the code.}
    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 18}
    
Emit a quality notice when the eLOC within a
function exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{An extremely large function is very difficult to maintain and understand.  When a function exceeds 200 eLOC (effective lines of code), it typically indicates that the function could be broken down into several functions.  Small modules are desirable for modular composability.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 19}
 
Emit a quality notice when file white space
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Source code must be easily read.  A low percentage of white space indicates that the source code is crammed together thus compromising the readability of the code.  Typically white space less than 10 percent is considered crammed  code.}

    \\
    \hline \textbf{Quality Notice No. 20}
    
Emit a quality notice when file comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.  However, the content quality of the comment is just as important as the quantity of the comments.  For this reason you could use the -E option to extract all the comments from a file.  The reviewer should be able to read the comments and extract the story of the code.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 22}
 
Emit a quality notice when each if, else, for
or while is not bound by scope.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Logical blocks should be bound with scope.  This clearly marks the boundaries of scope for the logical blocks.  Many times, code may be added to non-scoped logic blocks thus pushing other lines of code from the active region of the logical construct giving rise to a logic defect.}
    \\
    \hline 
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 23}
    
Emit a quality notice when the '?' or the implied
if-then-else construct has been identified.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The ? operator creates the code equivalent of an "if" then "else" construct.  However the resultant source is far less readable.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 24}
 
Emit a quality notice when an ANSI C++ keyword is identified within a *.c or a *.h file.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ In C source code it is possible to find variable names like "class".  This word is a key word in C++ and would prevent this C code from being ported to the C++ language.}
    \\
    \hline
\textbf{Quality Notice No. 25} (Deprecated RSM 6.70) 

When analyzing *.h files for C++ keywords,
assume that *.h can be both C and C++.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{ A *.h file can be either a C or C++ source file.  If a *.h file is assumed to be from either language, then RSM will not emit C keyword notices in *.h file, only for *.c files.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 26}
 
Emit a quality notice when a void * is identified
within a source file.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A "void *" is a type-less pointer.  ANSI C and C++ strives to be type strict.  In C++ a "void *" breaks the type strict nature of the language which can give rise to anomalous run-time defects.}
    \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Quality Notice No. 27}
    
Emit a quality notice when the number of function return points is greater than the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A well constructed function has one entry point and one exit point.  Functions with multiple return points are difficult to debug and maintain.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 28}
 
Emit a quality notice when the cyclomatic complexity of a function exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Cyclomatic complexity is an indicator for the number of logical branches within a function.  A high degree of V(g), greater than 10 or 20, indicates that the function could be broken down into a more modular design of smaller functions.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 29}
        
Emit a quality notice when the number of function input parameters exceeds the specified maximum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A high number of input parameters to a function indicates poor modular design.  Data should be grouped into representative data types.  Functions should be specific to one purpose.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 30}
 
Emit a quality notice when a TAB character is identified within the source code. Indentation with TAB will create editor and device dependent formatting.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{Tab characters within source code create documents that are print and display device dependent.  The document may look correct on the screen but it may become unreadable when printed.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 31}
        
Emit a quality notice when class comment
percentage is less than the specified minimum.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A programmer must supply sufficient comments to enable the understandability of the source code.  Typically a comment percentage less than 10 percent is considered insufficient.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 43}
 
Emit a quality notice when the key word 'continue' has been identified within the source code.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The use of 'continue' in logical structures causes a disruption in the linear flow of the logic.  This style of  programming can make maintenance and readability difficult.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 46}
        
Emit a quality notice when function, struct, class or interface blank line percentages are less than the specified minimum
 
Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{The amount of blank lines in a file can indicate the degree of readability in the file. It indicates the author intended his work to be human consumable.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 47}
 
Emit a quality notice when the file blank line percentage is less than the specified minimum

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{The amount of blank lines in a file can indicate the degree of readability in the file. It indicates the author indented his work to be human consumable.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 48}
        
Emit a quality notice when a function has no logical lines of code. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{This condition indicates a no-op or stubbed out function with no operational code.Many code generators create such no-op functions which contribute to code bloat and unnecessary resource utilization.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 49}
 
Emit a quality notice when a function has no parameters in the parameter list.

Rationale:  \textcolor{red}{A function should always specify the actual parameter names to enhance maintenance and readability. A programmer should always put void to indicate the deliberate design in the code.}
    \\
    \hline
        \textbf{Quality Notice No. 50}
         
Emit a quality notice when a variable is assigned to a literal value. Configurable for literal 0 in rsm.cfg. 

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A symbolic constant is the preferred method for variable assignment as this creates maintainable and understandable code.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 51}
 
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a function block. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A function block should retain a preceding comment block describing the purpose, parameters, returns and algorithms.}
    \\
    \hline
     \textbf{Quality Notice No. 52}
     
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a class block. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A class block should retain a preceding comment block describing the purpose, and algorithms.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 53}
 
Emit a quality notice when there is no comment before a struct block. 

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A struct block should retain a preceding comment block describing the data and purpose.}
    \\
    \hline
     \textbf{Quality Notice No. 55}
     
Emit a quality notice when scope exceeds the specified maximum in the rsm.cfg file. 
 
Rationale: \textcolor{red}{A deep scope block of complex logic or levels may indicate a maintenance concern.}
 & \textbf{Quality Notice No. 56}
 
Emit a quality notice when sequential break statements are identified.

Rationale: \textcolor{red}{Repetitive and sequential breaks can be used to fool RSM identification of case statement without breaks.}

\subsection{Complexity Metrics}
Reflecting on elements that can contribute to increase the complexity of a program and influencing in its maintenance, four elements are identified:
\begin{itemize}
\item Program Size
\item Data Structure
\item Data Flow
\item Control Flow
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Program Size Metrics}
\label{sec:sizem}
Very large programs are complex even if only be for the large amount of information to be considered in order to understand them. So a first measure of the code complexity is given by its size. This size can be determined using the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of lines
\item Halsted metrics (See \ref{sec:halsted})
\end{itemize}

Count the number of code lines in a program is a simple way to measure its size. The main problem with this metric is to decide what we consider as line.
The reason is that there is no standard definition of what a line of code is. Do comments count? Are data declarations included? What happens if a statement extends over several lines? – These are the questions that often arise. According to the criteria that we follow a different metric will be obtained.

For example, in C language, a line of code can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item an statement, instruction finished in a jump line
\item an statement, instruction terminated with a semi-colon
\item any line of the program terminated with a new line (comments included)
\end{itemize}

As there is no standard definition and the definitions of these metrics are tied to specific computer languages, a definition of how the RSM tool considers these code metrics is indicated below.

\begin{itemize}
\item An effective line of code is the measurement of all lines that are not comments, blanks or standalone braces or parenthesis. RSM counts the instances of lines that contain a single brace and parenthesis and creates a metric for effective lines of source code, eLOC. This metric is the result of subtracting the single braces and parenthesis from the LOC measurement.
\item Logical lines of code represent a metrics for those line of code which form code statements. These statements are terminated with a semi-colon. The control line for the "for" loop contain two semi-colons but accounts for only one semi colon.
\item Comments: RSM counts a comment line as any physical line that contains a comment.
\end{itemize}

Taking into account these criterias the following size metrics are obtained:

\begin{longtable}{||p{.275\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}||}

The following table describes some recommendations for the lines-of-code measures:

  \caption{\label{lst:recom} Recommendations}\\
    \hline\hline
    \textbf{Measures} & \textbf{Values} & \textbf{Comments}\\
    \hline\hline
    \endhead
    \hline\hline
    \endfoot
    \ Function length & 4-40 program lines
& A function definition contains at least a prototype, one line of code, and a pair of braces, which makes 4 lines.

A function longer than 40 program lines probably implements many functions. Functions containing one selection statement with many branches are an exception to this rule.

Decomposing them into smaler functions often decreases readability.
    \\
    \hline
    \ File length & 4-400 program lines
& The smallest entity that may reasonably occupy a whole source file is a function, and the minimum length of a function is 4 lines. Files longer than 400 program lines (10..40 functions) are usually too long to be understood as a whole.
    \\
    \hline
    \ Comments Percentage & 30\%-75\%
& If less than one third of a file is comments the file is either very trivial or poorly explained.

If more than 75\% of a file are comments, the file is not a program but a document.
In a well-documented header file percentage of comments may sometimes exceed 75\%
    \\
    \hline
   \end{longtable}

By analyzing the results, one can observe the Bitwalker.c file fulfills the recommendations in relation to the file length. Although the comments percentage (26\%) is a little bite under the recommended value, this do not indicate a poor documentation of source code.

\subsubsection{Control Flow Metrics}
\label{sec:cyclo}
The possibility that the execution flow of a program follows different paths depending on whether or not certain conditions are met, increases the difficulty to understand what the program do in each of the situations that may occur.

One metric that addresses the complexity of the control flow is the \textbf{Cyclomatic complexity}. 

The cyclomatic complexity metric measures the complexity of the code by counting the number of independent paths through a piece of code-by counting the number of decision points. The decision point is where a choice can be made during execution; this gives rise to different paths through the code. Decision points arise through if statements and through while, do while and for loops. A single switch or try statement can also add many more decision points. This metric can either be determined by counting the regions, nodes and edges or number of predicate nodes (branching points) with a flow graph.


The following equations defined McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of regions in a flow graph.
\item V(g) = E - N + 2P, where E are the edges, N are the nodes and P nodes without outgoing path.
\item V(g) = P + n, where P are the predicate nodes and n the number of output.
\end{itemize}

When the graph is strongly connected, a simplified formula to calcule the cyclomatic complexity is use: V(g) = P + 1, where P are the predicate nodes.

The result obtained in the calculation of the cyclomatic complexity also determines the upper bound on the number of tests that must be performed to ensure that each statement is executed at least once.

At following the results of some complexity metrics obtained by the RSM tool are shown:

The interface complexity is defined by RSM as the number of input parameters to a function plus the number of return states from that function. Class interface complexity is the sum of all function interface complexity metrics within that class.

The Maximun total complexity is the addition of Maximun Interface and Cyclomatic complexities and the total Cyclomatic complexity is calculated as the sumn of the cyclomatic complexity of each function of the file. 

Knowing that a program has a high value of cyclomatic complexity (total Cyclomatic complexity) does not provide us enough info to decide what actions to take to improve our software. This occurs due to there is not an approximate threshold reference value for total cyclomatic complexity since not all software has the same size. However we can say that the cyclomatic complexity of each function should not exceed a certain value.

Due to this, a more detailed Complexity analysis per function is provided at following.

After calculating the cyclomatic complexity the risk involved can be determined using the following table:

{\footnotesize\sffamily\centering
  \begin{longtable}{||p{.15\textwidth}|p{.40\textwidth}||}
  \caption{Mc Cabe cyclomatic Complexity Reference table}\\
    \hline\hline
    \textbf{Cyclomatic Complexity} & \textbf{Risk Evaluation} \\
    \hline\hline
    \endhead
    \hline\hline
    \endfoot
    \textbf{1-10}
& Low risk
    \\
    \hline
    \textbf{11-20}
& More complex, Moderate risk
    \\
    \hline
    \textbf{21-50}
& Complex, High Risk
    \\
    \hline
    \textbf{>50}
& Not testable, Very High Risk
    \\
    \hline
\end{longtable}}

If we cross the values ​​obtained in the analysis with the indicative table we can see that all functions are under 10, so we speak of simple functions with little logic and with low risk.

In addition to the Limited Size and Complexity in Functions, Subrutines and Methods and Coding Standard techniques, at following we can see that taking into account the modular approach where one of its rule mentions that it shall specify a restriction for the number of paramenters (normally 5) the Parameter Number Limit is fulfilled.

Furthermore, from the previous definition of recommended values for lines of code measures (see \ref{lst:recom}), we can see there is not documentation for some functions.

Now, an example of the cyclomatic complexity calculation for the bitwalker\_Poke function is shown to compare the correctness of these results .

\begin{listing}[hbt]
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[style=acsl-block, frame=single]{./figures/poke.impl}

The control flow generated from the bitwalker\_Poke function would look like figure 4.1.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./figures/flow.png}
\caption{Bitwalker\_Poke Flow}
\end{figure}

In this flow, 4 predicated nodes are displayed so, taking into account the equation V(g) = P + 1, where P are the predicate nodes, we see that the cyclomatic complexity of this function is V(g)=5.

\section{LocMetrics tool Results}

\href{http://www.locmetrics.com/}{[LocMetrics]} tool counts total lines of code (LOC), blank lines of code (BLOC), comment lines of code (CLOC), lines with both code and comments (C\&SLOC), logical source lines of code (SLOC-L), McCabe VG complexity (MVG), Header Comments (HCLOC), Header Words (HCWORD) and number of comment words (CWORDS). Physical executable source lines of code (SLOC-P) is calculated as the total lines of source code minus blank lines and comment lines. Counts are calculated on a per file basis and accumulated for the entire project. LocMetrics also generates a comment word histogram.

After a review of the subset of MISRA-C rules taking into account project requirements and sector standard or best practices it is necessary to decide which of some of them are not to be implemented/approved due to its application can get worse understanbility of the code and which other rules of other standard will be applied.

The table below shows the non approved MISRA-C rules.

In addition to the MISRA-C compliance checking, we also run code metrics analysis in order to ensure the correctness of the obtained results through the results comparation.

Below tables shows some different metrics per file and function.
In order to understand the tables and to be able to compare the results obtained with the different tools the definition of the specific metrics is provided before the presentation of the corresponding table.
\begin{itemize}
\item Cyclomatic: The measure of the complexity of a function's decision structure. The cyclomatic complexity is also the number of basis, or independent, paths through a module. 
\item Modified Cyclomatic: cyclomatic except each case statement is not counted;the entire switch counts as 1.
\item Strict: Cyclomatic complexity except each short-circuit operator adds 1 to the complexity.
\item Essential Complexity: cyclomatic complexity after structured programming constructs have been removed.
\item Nesting: maximum nesting level of control constucts (if, while,etc.)
\item Count Path: Number of unique paths through a body of code (not counting gotos or abnormal exits

Taking into account control flow and data flow techniques some Uninitialized Items (items such as variables that are not initialized in the code), Unused Variables and Parameters items (items that are declared (and perhaps initialized) but never referenced other than that) and Unused Program Units have been identified. The Unused Program Units Report identifies program units that are declared but never used. However note that this listing in this report doesnt mean the system doesnt need this program unit.

Taking into account the features checked by the tool, the following Cenelec Standard techniques have been covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Boundary Value Analysis (High Recommended)
\item Data Flow Analysis (High Recommended)
\end{itemize}

After run this analysis no violation has been found.

\section{CPPcheck tool Results}

Bitwalker folder has been analyzed statically by \href{http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/}{[CPPcheck]} tool (Complying with the standard C11).

Cppcheck supports the following languages: C89, C99, C11 and a wide variety of static checks. The following features are provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item Out of bounds checking
\item Check the code for each class
\item Checking exception safety
\item Memory leaks checking
\item Warn if obsolete functions are used
\item Check for invalid usage of STL
\item Check for uninitialized variables and unused functions
\item Check input/output operations
\item Null pointer dereferencing
\end{itemize}

C11 (formerly C1X) is an informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2011, the current standard for the C programming language. It replaces the previous C standard, informally known as C99. This new version mainly standardizes features that have already been supported by common contemporary compilers, and includes a detailed memory model to better support multiple threads of execution. Due to delayed availability of conforming C99 implementations, C11 makes certain features optional, to make it easier to comply with the core language standard.

With the use of this tool the following techniques recommended by CENELEC Standard are covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Coding Standard (mandatory) (checked C11 standard)
\item Boundary Value Analysis (High Recommended)
\item Data Flow Analysis (High Recommended)
\end{itemize}

The results of the tool show that there are some verbose errors in the main file and some errors in the bitwalker.c file.

\begin{itemize}
\item repetitive verbose error regarding to Testwort variable is reassigned value before the old one has been used (lines 119, 120 and 121 in main.c)
\item one error about the Testwort variable is assigned a value that is never used (line 122 in main.c).
\item the funtions Bitwalker\_IncrementalWalker\_Peek\_Finish (line 91 in bitwalker.c), Bitwalker\_IncrementalWalker\_Peek\_Next (line 82 in bitwalker.c) and Bitwalker\_IncrementalWalker\_Poke\_Finish (line 106 in bitwalker.c) are never used,
\end{itemize}

\section{Testwell CMT++ Results}
\label{sec:halsted}
CMT++, Complexity Measures Tool for C/C++, is an easy-to-use code metrics tool for C and C++ languages. Also assembly code, either inlined in a C/C++ source file or separate assembly file, can be measured.

Based on the static properties of the program code CMT++ gives estimates how error prone the program sorce code is due to its complexity, how long it will take to understand the code, what the logical volume of the code is, how much code you have: physical lines, comment lines, program lines, statements, etc

CMT++ helps to estimate the overall maintainability of the code base and easily locate the complex parts of it. 

In this case CMT++ is used to calculate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic code complexity metrics
\begin{itemize}
\item McCabe's cyclomatic number
\item Halstead's metrics
\item Lines of code metrics
\item Some other metrics like: number of semicolons, number of function parameter, depth of control structure nesting
\end{itemize}
\item Maintainability Index
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Complexity Metrics}
\subsubsection{Program Size Metrics}
As it was mentioned in \ref{sec:sizem} the number of lines and the Halsted metrics can be used to determine the program size.
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Number of lines}

The lines of code measures are the most traditional measures used to quantify software complexity. They are simple, easy to count, and very easy to understand. However, they do not take into account the intelligence content and the layout of the code.

CMT++ calculates the following lines-of-code metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item LOCphy: number of physical lines
\item LOCbl: number of blank lines (a blank line inside a comment block is considered to be a comment line)
\item LOCpro: number of program lines (declarations, definitions, directives, and code)
\item LOCcom: number of comment lines
\end{itemize}

Following the analysis conducted within the tool, the tables below summarizes the results:

\item \textbf{Halsted metrics}

Halstead complexity metrics were developed by the late Maurice Halstead as a means of determining a quantitative measure of complexity directly from the operators and operands in the module to measure a program module's complexity directly from source code.

Halstead's metrics are based on interpreting the source code as a sequence of tokens and classifying each token to be an operator or an operand. There are based on four basic measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item number of unique (distinct) operators ($n_1$)
\item number of unique (distinct) operands ($n_2$)
\item total number of operators ($N_1$)
\item total number of operands ($N_2$).
\end{itemize}

Taking into account these measures the following metrics will be obtained:
\begin{itemize}
\item Program Vocabulary: $n = n_1 + n_2$
\item Program Length: $N = N_1 + N_2$
\item Program Difficulty: $D = ( n_1 / 2 ) * ( N_2 / n_2 )$
\item Program Volume: $V = N * log_2 (n)$
\item Program Length: L = 1/V
\item Effort to implement: E = V * D
\item Time to implement: T = E / 18
\item Number of delivered bugs: $B = (E^{2/3}) / 3000$
\end{itemize}

So Halsted metrics provide several metrics that focus on different aspects of software complexity. Furthermore, they allow the estimation of development and testing times (with parameter L*V), and difficulty of understanding (with parameter E). 

Software complexity is usually analyzed with the indicators L, V and E due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item the volume is intended being a more accurate measure of the difficulty of understanding a program, taking into account not only its length but also the vocabulary. Halstead's volume (V) describes the size of the implementation of an algorithm.
\item the program level gives an idea of ​​the level of detail that it has been encoded
\item effort can be used as a measure of program clarity since the effort required to produce a piece of software is primarily related to the difficulty to understand and implement it.
\end{itemize}

The volume of a function should be at least 20 and at most 1000. The volume of a parameter less one-line function that is not empty; is about 20. A volume greater than 1000 tells that the function probably does too many things.

The volume of a file should be at least 100 and at most 8000. These limits are based on volumes measured for files whose LOCpro and v(G) are near their recommended limits. The limits of volume can be used for double-checking.

Halstead's delivered bugs (B) is an estimate for the number of errors in the implementation.
Delivered bugs in a file should be less than 2. 
Experiences have shown that, when programming with C or C++, a source file almost always contains more errors than B suggests. The number of defects tends to grow more rapidly than B.

By analyzing the results, one can observe that all the Halsted metrics obtained in relation to functions and file are inside the recommendations.

As a first conclusion, taking into account the reference table shown in Section \ref{sec:cyclo} the values from the above table indicate a low risk functions and the matching with the results obtained with the previous tools.

\subsection{Maintainability Index}
Maintainability Index (MI) is a single-number value for estimating the relative maintainability of the code.

Maintainability Index is calculated with certain formulae from lines-of-code measures, McCabe measure and Halstead measures.

Actually there are three measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item MIwoc: Maintainability Index without comments
\item MIcw: Maintainability Index comment weight
\item MI: Maintainability Index = MIwoc + MIcw
\end{itemize}

The general formulae for MI is the following:

MIwoc = 171 - 5.2 * ln(aveV) -0.23 * aveG -16.2 * ln(aveLOC)

MIcw = 50 * sin(sqrt(2.4 * perCM))

MI = MIwoc + MIcw

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item aveV = average Halstead Volume per Module
\item aveG = average extended cyclomatic complexity per Module
\item aveLOC = average count of lines per Module
\item perCM = average percent of lines of comments per Module
\end{itemize}

\begin{longtable}{||p{.475\textwidth}|p{.075\textwidth}|p{.070\textwidth}|p{.070\textwidth}||}

    \hline

    \\
    \hline
   \end{longtable}

After calculating the Maintainability Index the maintainability involved can be determined using the following reference table:

{\footnotesize\sffamily\centering

    \\

As a first conclusion, the values from the tables above indicate the functions and file have a good maintanability.

\section{MISRA and Mü8004 Rules Comparison}
This section analyses the requirements designed in MISRA-C : 2004 standard and Mü8004 standard and makes a comparison between rules they might have in common and describes the most important features of the ones they don’t have in common. 

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{ENVIRONMENT:}}
\end{center}

%% Debut FRR
\paragraph{MISRA –C Environment Rule 1.1}
MISRA-C Rule 1.1 All code shall conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1990
“Programming languages — C”, amended and corrected by
ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1995, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and
ISO/IEC 9899/COR2:1996.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. It never mentions which version of C is applied.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Environment Rule 1.2}
MISRA-C Rule 1.2 No reliance shall be placed on undefined or unspecified
behaviour.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. No requirement on behaviour is specified.
%% Fin FRR

\paragraph{MISRA –C Environment Rule 1.3}
MISRA-C Rule 1.3 Description: If a module is to be implemented in a language other than C, or compiled on a different C compiler, then it is essential to ensure that the module will integrate correctly with other modules.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. Mü8004 standard establishes in rule 0.2.22 that it is not allowed to change the programming language inside a program module, but not between different modules.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Environment Rule 1.4}
MISRA-C Rule 1.4 Description: The compiler/linker shall be checked to ensure that 31 character significance and case sensitive are supported for external identifiers. If the compiler/linker is not capable of meeting this limit, then use the limit of the compiler.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard, although in 0.2.9 rule it is referred that names and identifiers must be chosen in a way that differs significantly in the first 31 positions. This rule should be added.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Environment Rule 1.5}
MISRA-C Rule 1.5 Description: Floating-point implementations should comply with a defined floating-point standard.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard and it would be useful adding it to overcome a wide range of problems associated with the use of floating-point arithmetics.

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{LANGUAGE EXTENSION:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Language extensions 2.1}
MISRA-C Rule 2.1 Description: Where assembly language instructions are required it is recommended that they be encapsulated and isolated in either (a) assembler functions, (b) functions or (c) macros.

This rule is included in Mü8004 Rule 0.2.22, as it establishes that assembler implemented subroutines can be called from C and vice versa. It would be useful to point out that assembler language should not be embedded in normal code.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Language extensions 2.2}
MISRA-C Rule 2.2 Description: Source code shall only use /*…*/ style comments.

This is less restrictive in Mü8004 standard, as // comments are allowed in Mü8004 Rule 0.2.8 if it is supported by compiler. This is correctly focused as this way consistency is not in danger.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Language extensions 2.3}
MISRA-C Rule 2.2 Description: The character sequence /* shall not be used within a comment.

This rule is included in Mü8004 Rule 0.2.8, as it establishes that comments must not be nested. This is an important requirement whom omission would cause critical errors otherwise.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Language extensions 2.4}
MISRA-C Rule 2.4 Description: Sections of code should not be “commented out”

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. It would be useful to use conditional compilation (\#if or \#ifdef) for sections of source code not to be compiled, as start and end comment markers for this purpose is dangerous because C does not support nested comments.

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{CHARACTER SETS:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Character sets 4.1}
MISRA-C Rule 4.1 Only those escape sequences that are defined in the ISO C
standard shall be used.

Mü8004 standard does not include this rule. This rules is useful for code portabiliy.
 
\paragraph{MISRA –C Character sets 4.2}
MISRA-C Rule 4.2 Trigraphs shall not be used.


Mü8004 standard does not include this rule. This rules is useful for code understanding. This rule should be mandatory.

%% Fin FRR

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{IDENTIFIERS:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.1}
MISRA-C Rule 5.1 Description: Identifiers (internal and external) shall not rely on the significance of more than 31 characters.

This rule is included in Mü8004 Rule 0.2.9, as it establishes that names and identifiers must be chosen in a way that they differ significantly in the first 31 positions.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.2}
MISRA-C Rule 5.2 Description: Identifiers in an inner scope shall not use the same name as an identifier in an outer scope, and therefore hide that identifier.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard, but it would be useful adding it to avoid confusion between identifiers in the code.


\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.3}
MISRA-C Rule 5.3 Description: A typedef name shall be a unique identifier.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard, but it would be useful adding it to avoid the reuse this names within a program.


\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.4}
MISRA-C Rule 5.4 Description: A tag name shall be a unique identifier.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. Although Mü8004 Rule 0.2.9 establishes that same variables should not serve different purposes and it would be useful to avoid the reuse of names within a program for same purposes. This would be useful adding it to avoid confusion.


\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.5}
MISRA-C Rule 5.5 Description: No object or function identifier with static storage duration should be reused.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. It would be useful adding it because the possibility exists for the user to incorrectly associate unrelated variables with the same name.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.6}
MISRA-C Rule 5.6 Description: No identifier in one name space should have the same spelling as an identifier in another name space, with the exception of structure member and union member names.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. It extends the avoidance of using same names for same or different purposes. It could be an advisory request to avoid confusion.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Identifiers 5.7}
MISRA-C Rule 5.7 Description: No identifier name should be reused (across any files in the system).

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. It incorporated the Rules 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. It would be an extremely severe requirement to avoid confusion between names.

\paragraph{Mü8004 Identifiers 0.2.9}
Some points of this section, as the following ones, are very important to avoid confusion between names and are not included in Identifiers section in MISRA-C standard:
\begin{itemize}
\item Uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers from 0 to 9, and the sign \$ and \_ are allowed for defining names. ‘\_’ must not be the first character
\item Identifiers that differ only in uppercase/lowercase characters must not have different meaning
\item Identifiers for macros shall be written in uppercase letter
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{TYPES:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 6.1}
MISRA-C Rule 6.1 Description: The plain char type shall be used only for the storage and use of character values

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. This rule could be useful to set the restriction in the work with this type of data.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 6.2}
MISRA-C Rule 6.2 Description: signed and unsigned char type shall be used only for the storage and use of numeric values. Plain char type shall be used for character data.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard. This rule could be useful to make a difference between the work with numeric and character data.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 6.3}
MISRA-C Rule 6.3 Description: Typedefs that indicate size and signedness should be used in place of the basic numerical types

Mü8004 standard does not show how to use typedef with different data types. However, it shows in Rule 0.2.6 that float and double data types are not supported. This could be a drawback for the precision of variables and operations between them.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 6.4}
MISRA-C Rule 6.4 Description: Bit fields shall only be defined to be of type unsigned int or signed int.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard, although Mü8004 Rule 0.2.6 establishes that bitfields are permitted. This rule could be useful for the correctness in the work with bitfields.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 6.5}
MISRA-C Rule 6.5 Description: Bit fields of signed type shall be at least 2 bits long.

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{CONSTANTS:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 7.1}
MISRA-C Rule 7.1 Description: Octal constants (other than zero) and octal escape sequences shall not be used

This rule is not included in Mü8004 standard for the definition of constants. Although it defines how to create constants using “const” keyword, it could be interesting not to mix constants and octal, because of potential errors when working with fixed length constants

\paragraph{Mü8004 – 0.2.10 Constants}
Mü8004 – 0.2.10 Constants Rule: Although MISRA-C adds 7.1 Rule that describes the work with octal constants in the standard, Mü8004 - 0.2.10 Constants rule specifies better which is the way to define constants of different type, and the way to use them along the code.

\begin{center}
\textsc{\underline{DECLARATIONS AND DEFINITIONS:}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{MISRA –C Types 8.1}
MISRA-C Rule 7.1 Description: Functions shall have prototype declarations and the prototype shall be visible at both the function definition and call

Mü8004 standard includes at Rule 0.2.15 that function prototypes shall be used for every function whenever the compiler supports it. It would be useful to set the visibility of prototypes for the integrity of function definitions and calls.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.2}
MISRA-C Rule 8.2 Description: Whenever an object or function is declared or defined, its type shall be explicitly stated

Mü8004 standard includes at Rule 0.2.15 that function header have to define the function type.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.3}
MISRA-C Rule 8.3 Description: For each function parameter the type given in the declaration and definition shall be identical, and the return types shall also be identical

Mü8004 standard does not include this rule, but this rule should be necessary for the proper operation of the function. 

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.4}
MISRA-C Rule 8.4 Description: If objects or functions are declared more than once their types shall be compatible

Mü8004 standard does not include this rule. It might be good to add this rule to the proper functioning of the code, even though it would be recommendable not to declare objects or functions more than once in order to reduce the number of mistakes made.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.5}
MISRA-C Rule 8.5 Description: There shall be no definitions of objects or functions in a header file

Mü8004 standard does not include this rule.  Although Mü8004 Rule 0.2.5 establishes that function prototypes shall only be used in header files, there is no reference to the definition of objects and functions. To prohibit the definition of objects and functions in the header file would be a good programming rule.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.6}
MISRA-C Rule 8.6 Description: Functions shall be declared at file scope

There is a restriction in Mü8004 standard Rule 0.2.5 when declaring functions at file scope, because it establishes that function prototypes shall only be used in header files.

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.7}
MISRA-C Rule 8.7 Description: Objects shall be defined at block scope if they are only accessed from within a single function

Mü8004 standard Rule 0.2.14 establishes that global definitions of structures shall be defined in header files. It would be interesting to add MISRA-C Rule 8.7 for objects that are only used in functions or in block scope.  

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.8}
MISRA-C Rule 8.8 Description: An external object or function shall be declared in one and only one (external) file

This rule can be added to Mü8004 standard to improve 0.2.14 Rule, as it defines that global definition of structures shall be defined in header files

\paragraph{MISRA –C Declarations and Definitions 8.9}
MISRA-C Rule 8.9 Description: An identifier with external linkage shall have exactly one external definition

Mü8004 does not include this rule. It is necessary to add this rule to fix the work with extern parameter.

\section{Conclusions}

Static analysis tools are very good due to the detection of several problem/errors at code level that are usually difficult to detect by manual inspection. Furthermore, they help enforce coding standards and keep code complexity low.

However, these tools sometimes report false positives so it is necessary review them and decide if they are related with problems or not. Nonetheless, it is recommended to complement the static analysis tools with manual code inspections (not thought of by the original coder) and dynamic analysis.

In order to ensure the correctness of the obtained results mentioned in the previous sections, a comparison of them was executed.

\begin{longtable}{||p{.225\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}|p{.125\textwidth}||}

 \\\hline
\end{longtable}

As a result of this comparison we obtain that between the tools there are some small deviations regarding some code metrics like total lines, comments or blank lines. Thus it was necessary to check how each aspect/metric is defined into each tool.

A manual inspection was done and the source of inconsistency is due to LocMetricss counts the last blank line of the file and RSM tool does not count the blank lines that are inside one commented section.

In addition to code size metrics of file, size code metrics per function were compared.

The total lines and program lines counts produced by some of the tool for the same product differ a little bit. 
The results clearly demonstrate the effects of existing ambiguities in code counting methodology and a variety of interpretations.

McCabe cyclomatic complexity was another complexity metric calculated by different of the selected tools.

According to McCabe a value of 10 is a practical upper limit for the cyclomatic complexity of a given module. When the complexity exceeds this value, it becomes very difficult to prove, understand and modify the module. However, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to relax the restriction and permit modules with a complexity as high as 15.

Analyzing the cyclomatic complexity metric measured one can observe the low risk of each function and all tools measured it in the same way.

In relation to the MISRA-C rules, as each tool verifies a subset of the rules defined in this standard, the results are different. However, the violations relationed with rules that are included in both RMS and Understand tool have been detected by both tools.

The accepted values for the metrics are defined based on the specific project requirements, project quality criteria or sector best practices. Depending on the metrics required for a project, one or more tools can be used. By this reason a selection of some MISRA-C and other standard to be applied shall be done and each specific violation and quality notice shall be analysed to check the suitability of applied the rule or not. 

Taking into account all the obtained results, we can concluded that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the functions and file have a good maintanability due to the maintainability Index is >85 in both of them
\item the functions have little logic and low risk regarding to the cyclomatic complexity values
\item the functions and file have an appropiate size and inside the recommendations due to line metrics and Halstead metrics.
\item there are some misra-c rules violations and quality notice although these shall be taken into account only in case they are related to the selected ruled to be applied.
\item there are some functions never used
\end{itemize}

In addition to these, as each existing static analysis tool implements different and very specific techniques (code metrics analysis, semantic analysis, context analysis -interactions between multiple functions calls-, creation of new rules, support coding rules/standard rules, ...) to achieve the required assessment or verification objectives, it is recommended to select different static analysis to cover all the commom areas where problems can occur.
