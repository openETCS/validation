  This document describes strategy and plan of the verification and
  validation activities in the project openETCS. As the goals of the
  project include the selection, adaption and construction of methods
  and tools for a FLOSS development in addition to performing actual
  development steps, differing from the plan for a full development
  project, the plan covers also activities evaluating the suitability
  of methods and tools, and it makes provisions for incorporation of
  V\&V of partial developments which are actually done.

  The overall strategy is to support the design process as specified
  in D2.3 and its partial instantiations within openETCS. In
  accordance with the project approach, V\&V shall be done in a FLOSS
  style, and it has to suit a model-based development. A further main
  consideration shall be to strive for conformance with the
  requirements of the standards (EN~50128 and further). This means
  that the contribution of all activities to a complete verification
  and validation shall be defined and assessed.

  The plan details how to perform \vv for a complete development which
  follows the process sketch from D2.3, so that the result conforms to
  the requirements of the standards for a SIL~4 development. This
  includes a definition of activities, the documentation to be
  produced, the organisation structure, roles, a selection of methods
  and tools, a format for describing design artifacts subject to V\&V,
  and a feedback format for the findings during V\&V.

  As D2.3 gives only a rough description of the development steps and
  not yet a complete list of design artifacts, nor one of methods
  applied and formats to be used, this first version of the V\&V plan
  will also lack detail which will to be added in later revisions as
  these informations become more concrete.

  Besides the usual purpose of \vv activities, namely evaluating and
  proving the suitability of design artifacts, V\&V in openETCS will
  also generate information on the suitability of the methods and tools
  employed. For that purpose, a format for describing methods
  and tools to be used in V\&V and one for summarizing the findings
  about the suitability are defined.

  The plan also contains partial instantiations of V\&V which match
  partial developments that are realised within openETCS.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

The purpose of this document is to define the \vv activities in the
project openETCS.  

{\it This document describes strategy and plan of the
  verification and validation activities in the project openETCS. As
  the goals of the project include the selection, adaption and
  construction of methods and tools for a FLOSS development in
  addition to performing actual development steps, differing from the
  plan for a full development project, the plan covers also activities
  evaluating the suitability of methods and tools, and it makes
  provisions for incorporation of V\&V of partial developments which
  are actually done.}

\nthng{
\begin{description}
\item[WP4-T1-G:] A useful plan for WP 4, that is, one that defines a
way to achieve the goals of WP 4:
  \begin{description}
  \item[WP4-G1:] Identify and demonstrate methods and tools to handle
    the V\&V of a FLOSS development of the EVC software
  \item[WP4-G2:] Perform as much of V\&V on the DAS2Vs produced in the
    project as possible
  \end{description}
\end{description}
}

\nthng{
\paragraph{Detailed Goals and Means}
\label{sec:detailed-goals-means}

\begin{description}
\item[WP4-T1-G1:] The plan shall give an overview of and a structure to
  the things required from V\&V for an openETCS (FLOSS-) development.
  \begin{description}
  \item[WP4-T1-M1:] Identifies all (most) of the activities which have
    to be made for a full development according to the standards, in a
    form relevant to the approach of openETCS (FLOSS,
    participants). This may include alternatives.
  \end{description}
\item[WP4-T1-G2:] The plan shall provide a framework into which the V\&V
  activities which will be performed within the project do fit.
  \begin{description}
  \item[WP4-T1-M2-1:] Design formats for collecting information about
    DAS2Vs (V\&V tasks), about the results of V\&V activities, about
    activities of V\&V method and tool development, about the results
    of evaluations of V\&V methods and tools. Sketch how all of the
    information is to be gathered and finally incorporated into the
    final V\&V report (D4.4).
  \item[WP4-T1-M2-2:] Identify potential variants of partial
    implementations of V\&V processes which are likely going to be
    performed within the project. These may be (?should be?) related
    to design activities within the project which produce DAS2Vs.

    consists of a set of related DASVs and V\&V steps to be applied to
    them. A V\&V step is described by input and output (result,
    purpose) with V\&V methods and means.
  \item[WP4-T1-M3-2:] The plan will prepare the selection of adequate
    methods and means (tools) by providing evaluation criteria and
    incorporating available evaluation results.
  \item[WP4-T1-M3-2-1:] Definition of an evaluation format for tools
    and methods.
  \end{description}
\item[WP4-T1-G4:] The plan shall incorporate currently available

  amendable to future changes and additions.
  \begin{description}
  \item[WP4-T1-M4-1:] Use D2.3 in instantiating the general
    requirements laid down in the standards.
  \item[WP4-T1-M4-2:] Use D2.1 for tools.
  \item[WP4-T1-M4-3:] Identify open points and include delineations
    for things which are useful for a complete V\&V but not yet
    planned or detailed by project activities already performed.
  \end{description}
\end{description}
}

This document describes which verification and validation activities
are needed for a full FLOSS development of the EVC software. It
describes how the work performed within the project openETCS is to be
organised to contribute to such a task, and how to demonstrate that it
can be realised.

The document is only valid in conjunction with the Quality Assurance
plan \cite{QAplan}. It is supplemented by the safety plan, which
focuses on the safety aspect. Verification and validation play an
important role in the safety case. This document identifies the V\&V
activities which do contribute and refers to the safety plan for
further details on the additional requirements to be met and a precise
statement of what has to be established.

\section{Document Structure}
\label{sec:document-structure}

This document comprises both verification and validation plan, as
these activities share some of their methods and tools, and in some
case are applied to the same design artifacts. Nevertheless, these
activities are intended to be and remain independent.

There are three main issues which make this plan different from an
ordinary V\&V plan for a software to develop. First, openETCS is not
only concerned with the software part of the EVC. As part of the
activities, a semi-formal model for SS~026 is to be developed and to
be verified. As the SS~026 covers parts of the ETCS system beyond the
software, also process steps on the system (not just software) level
are to be performed. And in particular the design does not start with
a clearly defined set of requirements on the software.

As a second point, openETCS will not only do development, but
shall also be concerned with processes, methods and tools with the
goal of being able to propose a complete SIL~4 compliant approach. As
part of this, it has to be defined how to handle verification and
validation. This is done in the sections
addressing a ``full development''. Due to the limited resources of the
project, actually performing such a full development is out of the
project's scope. Instead, only some functions will be implemented, and
only partial lines of development will be realised. V\&V related to
these activities is to be planned in the specific sections dedicated
to  ``openETCS''.

\section{Background Information}
\label{sec:backgr-inform}

%\todo{Further Info, perhaps put the project context here }

\subsection{Definitions}

\paragraph{Verification}

Verification is an activity which has to be performed at each step of
the design. It has to be verified that the design step achieved its
goals. This consists at least of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item that the artifacts produced in the step are of the right type
  and contain allthe information they should. E.g., that the SSRS
  identifies all components addressed in SS~026, specifies their
  interfaces in sufficient detail and has allocated the functions to
  the components (this should just serve an example and is based on a
  guess what the SSRS should do)
\item that the artifact correctly implements the input requirements of
  the design step. These typically include the main output artifacts
  of the previous step. ``Correctly implements'' includes requirement
  coverage (tracing). This can and should be supported by some
  tools. Adequacy of such tools depends on things like format
  compatibility, degree of automation, functionality (e.g., ability to
  handle m-to-n relations). Depending on the design step (and the
  nature of the artifacts) different forms of verification will
  complement requirement coverage, with different levels of
  support. The step from SS~026 to the SSRS will mainly consist of
  manual activities besides things like coverage checks. Verifying a
  formal (executable) model against the SSRS can be supported by
  animation or simulation to e.g.\ execute test cases which have been
  designed to check compliance with the SSRS. Even formal proof tools
  may be employed to check or establish properties. Model-to-code steps
  offer far more options (and needs) for tool support. And tools or
  tool sets for unit test will support dynamic testing for requirement
  or code coverage. This may include test generation, test execution
  with report generation, test result evaluation and so on. Also, code
  generator verification (or qualification) may play a role,
  here. Integration steps mandate still other testing (or
  verification) techniques.
\end{itemize}
Summarizing, one may say that verification subsumes highly diverse
activities, and may be realized in very many different forms.

\paragraph{Validation}
%\nocite{*}
Validation is name for the activity by which the compliance of the end
result with the initial requirements is shown. In the case of
openETCS, this means that the demonstrator (or parts of it) are
checked against the SS~026 or one of its close descendants (i.e.,
SSRS), taking also further sources of requirements from operational
scenarios and TSIs into accoutn. This will consist of testing the
equipment according to a test plan derived from the requirements and
detailed into concrete test cases at some later stage. Tool support
for validation will thus mainly concern test execution and evaluation,
perhaps supplemented by test derivation or test management. Ambitious
techniques like formal proof are most likely not applicable here.

Thus, the tool support for validation will not differ substantially
from that for similar verification activities.

One might also consider ``early'' validation activities, e.g.\
``validating'' an executable model against requirements from the
SS~026. These are not mandated by the standards and can per se not
replace  verification of design steps. They may nevertheless be worthwhile
as means for early defect detection.

Further (mostly complementary) information on V\&V can be found in the
report on the CENELEC standards (D2.2).

\chapter{Document Evolution}

The verification and validation plan shall be revised in the course of
the project as the design progresses and gets detailed and experiences
with verification and validation are made. This is in accordance with
the EN~50128, where it is required that the plan shall be maintained
throughout the development cycle.

\begin{description}
\item[V01, T0+13:] First version of the plan. 
\item[V02, T0+17:] First revision, based on the 1st V\&V interim
  reports on applicability of the V\&V approach to model and
  implementation/code (D4.2.1, D4.2.2)
\item[V03, T0+25:] Second revision, based on the internal reports on
  the applicability of the V\&V approach to prototypes of design
  models and code
\item[V04, T0+36:] Final version as part of the final V\&V report (D4.4) 
\end{description}

The first version of the plan is based on the available information of
the design process. This is not yet very detailed as also the
description in Chapter~\ref{cha:vv-design-process} of this report
shows. In particular, the nature of the SSRS is yet to be defined
precisely, and the architecture description including the HW/SW
partitioning needs to be revised.

Concrete plans of activities are thus still to be made, and methods
and tools to be applied will have to be selected. Only the first phase
of V\&V activities is described in Sec.~\ref{sec:first-level-verif}.

\chapter{\VV in the Design Process}
\label{cha:vv-design-process}

D2.3 defines the openETCS process on an abstract level. It already
defines the main steps. A slightly more detailed picture than the one
given in D2.3 is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:openETCSProcess}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/ProcessOpenETCS-BeM.png}
  \caption{openETCS Process (rough view)}
  \label{fig:openETCSProcess}
\end{figure}
%
As a basis for planning the V\&V activities, the process sketch
permits to name the main phases. Planning will need a
better definition of the stages (scope of the design artifacts,
level of detail, respective system boundaries), detailed planning a
specification of the artifacts to be produced. Version V01 of this
document will in these respects be of an accordingly preliminary
nature. 
 
\nthng{
\textit{The figure needs to be detailed to include all the main design
steps. E.g., the integration activities are subsumed within ``3e) V\&V
on code''. For instance, the integration into the demonstrator should
be made visible. In the end, the figure shall define merely the
``full'' development, this will be of more help than ``openETCS
implementation'' of it. }

The overall strategy is to support the design process as specified in
D2.3 and its partial instantiations within openETCS. In accordance
with the project approach, V\&V shall be done in a FLOSS style, and it
has to suit a model-based development. A further main consideration
shall be to strive for conformance with the requirements of the
standards (EN~50128 and further). Of particular importance in that
respect is of course the interface to the safety considerations and
the contribution of V\&V to the safety case.

W.r.t.\ \vv, openETCS shall achieve two goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a tool-supported method with which the EVC software can
  be developed and maintained so that it is suitable for integration
  in (SIL-4) certified products. This will be described in
  Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-full}, ``\VV Strategy for a Full Development''.
\item Perform part of the development (including tool and method
  evaluation and the study of tool qualification questions) on
  representative parts of the design. The plans for that will be
  detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-strategy-project}, ``\VV Strategy for openETCS''.
\end{enumerate}

In more detail, the verification and validation have to consider the
following aspects throughout the development process.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item functionalities of the system and the sub-system,
\item system and sub-system architecture,
\item external and internal interfaces of the sub-system,
\item software components,
\item performance and Safety objectives and constraints,
\item functional properties,
\item safety properties.
\end{itemize}

\section{\VV Strategy for a Full Development }
\label{sec:vv-strategy-full}


Here, the ideal shall be described: How will the V\&V part of a FLOSS
development of the open-source EVC software look like, what are its
constituents, and how do they act together in developing and
maintaining this software within the openETCS ecosystem.


\subsection{Verification Strategy for a Full Development}
\label{sec:verif-strategy-full}

This section defines the strategy for verifying a full development of
the EVC software from the requirements source
(ss~026+TSIs+\ldots). This ends with the verification of the
software/hardware integration. In current view, the API defines the
interface and relevant properties of the hardware. Thus, SW/HW
integration for openETCS will most probably done virtually with an
instantiation of the API playing the role of the hardware. 

\subsubsection{System Test Campaigns}
Testing is one of the main means for verification. The three main
features of test campaigns which need to be specified are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of the different campaigns for each design phase and
  their characteristics.
\item Definition of the campaign objectives, and of the kind of test
  to be performed in order to achieve these objectives.
\item Traceability matrix between characteristics to check/ validate
  and test cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{V\&V Actions Criteria}
These criteria shall define the acceptance of system or component
modification, and the interruption criteria shall define the condition
under which a test campaign should be stopped for instance. These
criteria have to bet set during the V\&V plan redaction.  During the
verification phase, these items are verified thanks to the actions
criteria list described in the subpart related to the development
phases and items verification.

\subsubsection{Organization Charts and Responsibilities} 
The plan shall define the roles and responsibilities of people
involved in the V\&V activities (according to standards and project
needs). Must also be defined the teams compositions, and the
deliverables product owners, as well as the group and committee for
modification.  These items are verified during the verification phase.

\subsubsection{Internal Means and Tools} 
The plan shall list and define the means and tools needed for V\&V
actions (also when they are needed).  These items are verified during
the verification phase.

\subsubsection{External Means and Tools} 
The plan shall list and define the means and the tools used by the
interfaces with the project, and which company or structure is using
them.  These items are verified during the verification phase.

\subsubsection{Development Phases and Item Verification}
The plan for the development phases verification is based on
requiement coverage at system and sub-system level.  The requirements
are usually decomposed and gathered in a table, and this table
constitutes a road-map for verification activities, and is closely
followed in order to figure out if the required items are covered, and
if so, in which document.  The following items give an overview of
items checked during verification phases, regarding the kind of
prescriptions checked, and the appropriate related development phase.

\begin{description}
\item[Introduction:] This part gives an overview of Verification
  general purposes, of main verification phases (Safety Specification
  of Software, architecture, and overall test campaign), and
  verification support formalism (harmonized against different
  Verification activities, can be a simple table).
\item[ Software Security/Safety Prescriptions Specification Phase:]
  Gives a list of prescriptions (specifications top level from a top
  level specification providing the customer needs), and trace their
  coverage (justification and in which document this justification is
  provided).  Here is an example: “Prescription specification related
  to Software safety should come out from upper level system safety
  prescriptions and from prescriptions from Security schedule.  This
  information should be communicated to the Software developer.”
\item[Design Phases and Software Development:] This phase is based on
  the same approach of the previous part, and prescriptions are
  gathered in a table.  The different categories considered are
  defined in the following parts: (), , detailed design and
  development prescriptions, coding prescriptions, Software modular
  tests and Software integration tests prescriptions.
\item[General Requiements:] For instance: design representations shall
  be based on a clearly defined notations, or limited to clearly
  stated characteristics
\item[Software Architecture Related Requirements:]. For instance: Any
  System Safety prescription modification related to security should
  be documented and acknowledged by the developer.
\item[Support Tools and Coding Languages Requirements:]. For instance:
  According to the type of development, the compliance with the given
  prescriptions is under the software supplier responsibility.
\item[Detailed Design and Development Prescriptions:] For instance:
  ``The Software shall be produced in order to insure the required
  modularity, testability and modification ease.''
\item[Coding Prescriptions:] For instance: ``Each Software code
  module shall be reviewed''
\item[Software Modular Tests Prescriptions:] For instance: ``Modular
  tests shall be documented''
\item[Software Integration Tests Requirements:] For instance:
  ``Integration test specification shall encompass: integration groups
  easily manageable, test cases and test data, test kinds,
  environment, tools configuration on test program, test acceptance
  criteria, corrective actions procedures''
\item[Software Security Validation Planning:] The same formalism as
  previous parts can be used, and this part sums up the different
  requirements/specification for the planning regarding the safety
  activity. For instance: ``Planning shall be managed in order to
  specify technical and process steps necessary to prove that the
  software is compliant with safety prescriptions''.
\item[Programmed Electronic Components (Hardware and Software):] This
  part is specifically related to the integration conditions. This
  part is not supposed to be considered in openETCS, as no
  integration is planned in the project so far.
\item[Software Safety Validation:] For instance: ``Validation
  activities shall be performed as specified in the validation plan''.
\item[Conclusion:] (related to the requirements coverage). In our
  case, the prescriptions are the requirements explained in the WP4
  (these prescriptions have to be refined from the different project
  inputs, such as CENELEC, SRS, FPP…).
\end{description}


\subsection{Validation Strategy for a Full Development}
\label{sec:valid-strategy-full}

Validation, according to the standard, starts after SW/HW
integration. In this section, it shall be detailed how this should
look like for the openETCS architecture approach (with SSRS and
API). Ideal would be a description of how a full openETCS EVC software
could be taken up by some manufacturer and brought to life in a
product (validation aspect only, of course). Validation will use tests
covering operational scenarios.  

Not-so-classical validation can start earlier when executable models
become available. If a model can be animated to run an operational
scenario (perhaps with some additional environment/rest-of-system
modeling), design defects may get unveiled before the real
validation. This is, however, not an activity which is mentioned as a
development activity in the standard EN~50128. Thus, to use results of
``early validation'' in a validation report requires a definition of
its role and an argument for its usefulness.

\subsubsection{Validation Case}
The aim of the Validation Report is to demonstrate that the objectives
of validation which have been set in the validation plan have been
achieved. This concerns the adequacy of the software design
documentation and that components and system behavior is compliant
with the software requirements.

The inputs for validation at system level are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Software Requirement Specification (design, architecture),
\item Sub-System Requirement Specification (encompassing the architecture, 
interface description and requirement allocation),
\item Application Programming Interface,
\item Internal and External constraints,
\item Validation constraints list,
\item Validation Plan,
\end{itemize}

The inputs for validation at software level are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Components Requirements Specification,
\item Integration Specification,
\item Integration Report,
\item Test Specifications,
\item Test reports.
\end{itemize}


The outputs are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Software Validation Report (Verdict on software ability to fulfill 
the objectives and functionalities defined in the requirement specification.),
\item Software Validation Verification Report,
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Safety Interface}
\label{sec:safety-interface}

The safety activities in the software development process are closely connected to the \vv activities as these provide the overall system safety requirements, derive corresponding safety related design specifications and collect the \vv documentation to build the safety case. The safety activities are identifying unwanted accidents resulting in harm and analyses the potential hazards, which could lead to the harm. Resulting from this in depth  analysis certain requirements are derived, which provide the overall safety goals for the system. If the initial risk of a hazard resulting in harm has to be reduced or the possibility of harm shall be eliminated at all specific safety designs are developed to reach the required risk. The \vv process has to verify these specifications and validated that the requirements hold for the developed software. Respectively, a complete documentation is needed to show in the safety case that this steps have been done according to the overall \vv plan.

Therefore three main interfaces to the safety activities have to be maintained in the \vv process:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Verification of safety design specification}: Based on risk control measures documented in the Hazard Log specific safety design specifications are derived and written in the backlogs for model and code development. As it is done for the overall model and code specification the verification activities have to demonstrate that all of the safety specifications have been implemented properly.
\item \textbf{Validation of safety requirements}: The overall software validation has to demonstrated that the safety goals are met by the developed product. Therefore the safety requirements which have been stated based on potential accidents and accepted risk levels have to be validated. As these in many cases requires proof for the absence of certain conditions, it is important that \vv activities work in a close iterations with the safety activities to ensure that the safety requirements are stated in a way that can be validated. 
\item \textbf{Creation of \vv documentation}: As the safe case has to provide the complete argumentation that all needed steps to ensure a qualified and safe development process have been performed properly, it is important that the \vv plan and all resulting \vv reports are coherent and allow to show a close chain of arguments. 
\end{itemize}



\section{\VV Strategy for openETCS}
\label{sec:vv-strategy-project}

The project will only perform part of the development, and thus also
only a part of the V\&V activities. These need to be defined and
planned. The overall approach shall be to try out the different
constituents on and in representative samples, so that the
realisability of the \vv strategy for a full development can
covincingly be demonstrated.

}

The section is going to instantiate the generic \VV plan from the standard to
the EVC development in openETCS-style (FLOSS). This entails the organisation,
a definition of the requirements, 
generic schedule covering all design steps, resources, responsibilities, 
tools, techniques, and methodologies to be 
deployed in order to perform the verification activities, and all the
documents which are to be produced.

The result must conform to the requirements of the standards for a
SIL~4 development.

  As D2.3 gives only a rough description of the development steps and
  not yet a complete list of design artifacts, nor one of methods
  applied and formats to be used, this first version (V01) of the V\&V plan
  will also lack detail which will to be added in later revisions as
  these informations become more concrete.

\section{\VV Plan Overview}
\label{sec:plan-overview}

This section gives an overview of the \vv plan for a full development. 

\subsection{\VV Organisation}
\label{sec:vv-organisation}

This section defines the relationship of verification and validation
to other efforts such as development, project management, quality
assurance, and configuration management. It defines the lines of
communication within the \vv, the authority for resolving issues, and
the authority for approving \vv deliverables. Here, the \vv aspect of
the ``openETCS-ecosystem'' should be outlined.



\subsection{\VV Activity Overview}
\label{sec:vv-activ-overv}

This section gives a short overview of the activities (Verification or Validation) which
happen at the respective development steps, to be detailed in the
subsequent sections. The numbering (e.g.\ 2e) refers to
Fig.~\ref{fig:openETCSProcess}. Abbreviations used are defined in the
glossary, Sec.~\ref{sec:glossary}.

\begin{description}
\item[SSRS---Verification (1c):] verification that the SSRS the requirements
  consistently extends the requirements base. 
\item[SSRS---Validation (1c):] Deriving a sub-system test specification
\item[SFM---Verification (2c):] Verification that the model formalises
  the requirements
\item[SFM---Validation (2c):] Detailing the test specification,
  perhaps validating the model (e.g.\ via animation)
\item[SW-SFM---Verification (3d):] Verifying the SW-HW architecture
  definition (should be somewhere) and the software model
\item[SW-SFM---Validation (3d):]Perhaps validation of the software model
\item[SW-FFM---Verification (3d):]  verification, employing also
  formal methods/tools 
\item[SW-FFM---Validation (3d):] validation, may e.g.\ employ model checkers
\item[Code---Verification (3e):] verification depends on the code
  generation method (manual, generated, generated with validated
  tool), unit test requirements have to be met, afterwards code
  integration tests
\item[Code---Validation (3e):] no specific activities foreseen
\end{description}

The following step descriptions are preliminary and shall serve as a
concept which is to be detailed in later revisions (V02 and up).
%
\begin{description}
\item[EVC Software---Verification (tbd):] Perform software system verification
\item[EVC Software---Validation (tbd):] Validation against user
  requirements/scenarios, broken down to software functionality
\item[SW/HW integration (tbd):] Use the API in a simulation
  environment as a replacement of actual SW/HW integration
\item[Final Validation (tbd):] Apply user (railway operator) requirements and scenarios (based
  on the sub-system test specification)
\end{description}

\subsection{Schedule}
The overview of the activities given above shalle be detailed in this
section. The objective here is to define an orderly flow of
material between project activities and verification tasks. 
\nthng{It describes the project life cycle and project milestones including completion dates.
Summarize the schedule of verification tasks and how verification results provide feedback to the whole openETCS process to support overall project management functions.
The objective of this section is to define an orderly flow of material between project activities and verification tasks.}

\subsection{\VV Resources}
\label{sec:vv-resources}

In a regular development project, resources needed to perform
verification tasks, including staffing, facilities, tools, finances,
and special procedural requirements such as security, access rights,
and documentation control, have to be defined. Here, where we define
merely a pattern of a V\&V plan, the emphasis will lie on spelling out
requirements and proposing
principal solutions.
\nthng{  
\textit{Guidance: This section summarizes the resources needed to
  perform verification tasks, including staffing, facilities, tools,
  finances, and special procedural requirements such as security,
  access rights, and documentation control.}
}

\subsection{Responsibilities}
\label{sec:vv-responsibilities}

\nthng{
\textit{Guidance: Identify the organization responsible for performing Verification tasks. There are two levels of responsibility--- 
general responsibilities and specific responsibilities for the verification tasks to be performed should be assigned to individuals. Here, in the general \vv plan, only the first are to be defined.}

\section{Requirements Base}
\label{sec:requirements-base}

This section shall provide references to all requirements 
against which the design is to be verified and validated. It does not include 
process requirements. For the latter, see Sec.~\ref{sec:appendix}.

The requirements on the EVC software origin in the SS-026 and TSI
specifications.



\section{\VV Methods and Tools }
\label{sec:methods-tools}

The project shall select / develop / describe a chain of methods and
tools for doing \vv in a full development. In Version V01, this
section collects proposals, which will be evaluated and from which
those suitable for real-life
development and maintenance of the open-source EVC software will be selected.

Each proposal described here shall be classified for which tasks and
activities in teh development it is intended, i.e., which role it
should take.

\subsection{On the Notion of ``Formal Methods''}
\label{sec:notion-formal-method}

As FLOSS relies to a large extent on the use of tools for generating, 
verifying and validating a design, ``formal methods'' necessarily will
play an important role in the openETCS activities.  

In common language, the notion {\em ``formal''} is often used in a
broad sense, meaning everything that can be described by rules, even
if they are rather vague.
%
Contrary to that, we use {\em ``formal''} in the narrow sense of
EN-50128 \cite[Section~D.28]{en50128},
meaning strictly mathematical techniques and methods.
%
Since the Aerospace Standard DO-178C \cite{DO-178C}
follows a similar understanding,
but gives more elaborate explanation in its supplementary document
%DO-333 
devoted to formal methods \cite{DO-333},
our presentation closely follows the terminology of the latter.


\begin{quote}
{\em Formal methods are mathematically based techniques for the
specification, development, and verification of software aspects of
digital systems.
%
The mathematical basis of formal methods consists
of formal logic, discrete mathematics, and computer-readable
languages.
%
The use of formal methods is motivated by the expectation
that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate
mathematical analyses can contribute to establishing the correctness
and robustness of a design.}

\hfill
\cite[Section~1.0, p.1]{DO-333}
\end{quote}


\subsection{Reviews and Inspections}
\label{sec:reviews-inspec}

Not everything can be done by formal methods. The introduction of reviews
 in the openETCS project will enable the
adherence to design specifications as well as ensuring that
appropriate coding techniques---for automatic generation as well as 
observation of relevant coding
standards---have been used.  The use of an appropriate review technique
will also help to ensure the consistency of approaches across development teams
and may result in improved standards through the identification of
best practice solutions.  Software reliability will be increased due
to the removal of a larger percentage of the errors that would
otherwise remain in the software. Specific analysis techniques
exist for predicting the reliability of software.

For verifying any product, whether it is a piece of
software, a design specification, test script or anything else, it is 
essential to carry out some sort of review or inspection process. 
The introduction of formal review processes provides us with 
definite points in time when we can carry out these essential 
assessments.

It is possible to review just about anything. In the openETCS project
all written documents, specifications, models and code can be
reviewed. It is also important to include all documents concerned with
the creation and delivery of the openETCS product. This means that
strategies, plans, approaches, operation and maintenance manual, user
guides, the contract that will initiate the work should all be
reviewed in a structured way.

\paragraph{Inspection}
On the other hand, an inspection is a visual examination of a software
product to detect and identify software anomalies, including errors
and deviations from standards and specifications
\cite{Fag76-99}. Inspections are peer examinations led by impartial
facilitators who are trained in inspection techniques. Determination
of remedial or investigative action for an anomaly is a mandatory
element of a software inspection, although the solution should not be
determined in the inspection meeting.

Both review and inspection methods shall be used in different
contexts during the execution of the Verification activities.

More information about the reviews can be found in Quality Assurance Plan
\cite{QAplan}.

\subsection{Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM)}

SAAM \cite{KABC96} is one of the simpler methods for a scenario-based architecture 
evaluation, and it was the first to be published. SAAM is suitable 
for the testing of software architectures with regard to quality 
attributes (qualitative requirements), such as
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Modifiability,
\item Portability,
\item Growth Potential,
\item Performance,
\item Reliability,
\end{itemize}
%
but also for the evaluation of the functionality (functional 
requirements) of a software architecture. 

In a SAAM evaluation basically scenarios are developed, 
prioritized and assigned to those parts of the software 
architecture to be tested that are affected by them. 
This may be sufficient to indicate problems in the architecture.

\subsection{Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)}	
\label{sec:atam}

ATAM \cite{ATAM} is used to review the design decisions of the architecture. 
It is checked whether the design decisions satisfactorily 
support the requirements concerning quality. Risks and 
compromises included in the architecture are identified 
and documented.

The process includes two phases. 
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first phase the necessary components 
	are presented. Then the architecture is checked and analyzed. 
\item In the second phase it is tested whether the analysis 
	and the test were correct and complete. Then the 
	results are summed up.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Based Testing Method}
\label{subsec:mbt}
\subsubsection{Model Based Testing Strategy - generalities}
Testing consists in executing the System Under Test (SUT)
 for some particular inputs and in assessing whether or not the
 corresponding SUT executions conform to some requirements.
 Whatever the testing technique used is, one has to define test cases
 to be submitted to the SUT and associate to them a decision procedure
 called oracle. The oracle allows the tester to compute verdicts according 
to what the executions of SUT (resulting from the test case submission) 
reveal about its correctness.
This correctness is measured with respect to requirements. Model based
 testing is a particular kind of testing technique in which requirements are 
described by models which are executable specifications. Their execution
 traces (or ``traces'' for short) are sequences of stimulations of the SUT and
 resulting observations of the SUT reactions. Test cases are sequences of 
stimulations that are selected from the test model. A sequence corresponding
 to an input test data can be obtained by considering a trace of the model and
 ”forgetting” all observations occurring in it. For functional testing, SUT is 
considered as a black bbox: the tester (a human or a test bench) can only
 stimulate the SUT and observe its reactions. Interactions between the tester
 and the SUT result on the definition of traces. Therefore, a SUT can be seen
 as a set of traces that is not known (since SUT is a black box) but the tester
 may discover some of those traces by interacting with SUT. The oracle is based
 on a so called conformance relation. A conformance relation is a mathematical
 relation between the set of traces of the SUT and the set of traces of the model.
 When these sets of traces fulfill the relation we say that the SUT conforms to 
the model. The oracle takes as inputs traces representing an interaction between
 the tester and the SUT and compute verdicts. Whatever the testing techniqu
e is, the set of possible verdicts always contain the verdict Fail which is emitted 
whenever the trace taken as input demonstrates that the SUT does not conform 
to the model. Depending on the testing technique used there may be different 
verdicts emitted when Fail is not emitted. These different verdicts reflect different
 traceability information related to interaction trace taken as input. In this section
 we briefly discuss two model based testing tools that we will use conjointly in the 
OpenETCS project.

Model based testing (MBT) may apply at different level during the
lifecycle:
\begin{itemize}
\item System integration testing
\item Software integration testing
\item High level code verification
\item Object code verification
\end{itemize}
High-level code verification may be performed on any host perform
whereas object code verification intends to test the running code on
the target hardware.

\paragraph{Model-Based System Integration Testing}
The objectives of MBT on system integration level are to
\begin{itemize}
\item validate the correctness and completeness of the development model,
\item verify that the generated code components cooperate correctly on the target HW, in 
order to achieve the system-level capabilities.
\end{itemize}

The first objective implies that the {\it test model} and the original
development model are separate entities; otherwise the system
integration test would just validate that all logical errors still
residing in the openETCS development model are really implemented in
the code. Even in presence of a formally validated development model,
in which high confidence can be placed, we prefer to create a separate
test model, because
\begin{itemize}
\item the test model may use a higher level of abstraction since only the SUT behaviour visible at the 
system interfaces is relevant,

\item the test model may specify different interfaces to the SUT,
  depending on the observable interfaces in a test suite; the
  observation level ranges from black-box (only the ``real'' SUT
  system interfaces are visible) to grey-box level (some global
  variables may be monitored or even manipulated by the testing
  environment, some task or object communications may be observed
  etc.),

\item the development model may contain errors that are only revealed
  during HW/SW integration (for example, calculations failing due to
  inadequate register word size, or deadlines missed due to
  insufficient CPU resources).
\end{itemize}

Software integration is performed by software-in-the-loop technology
on host computers. The software components as well as the complete
software are tested on host computer with a testing environment that
simulates the hardware behavior and the operational environment. The
main advantage is that all software properties can be easily simulated
and tested. The tests for software-in-the-loop may be generated from a
model but at this level unite test for each software functionalities
may also be performed.

\paragraph{Model-Based Testing of Generated High-Level Code}
Another application of MBT aims at the verification of generated
high-level code (for openETCS, the target language will be C).
If model-to-text transformations are not formally verified, it
is necessary to verify the outcome of each transformation. Since the transformation
source is a model $M$, MBT suites can be derived automatically from this model to show that the
generated code conforms to $M$. 

Observe that in contrast to system-level MBT no redundant model is used for this objective, but the
same model $M$ used for code generation can be used: we just have to verify the consistency between 
code and $M$, without validating $M$'s correctness and completeness. The latter task is separately performed
by means of 
\begin{itemize}
\item property checking or
\item simulation.
\end{itemize}
The model-based testing (MBT) approach can be used to create test
suites conforming to the highest criticality level of the applicable
CENELEC standards, in order to justify that the generated code is
consistent to its model~\cite{PeleskaVL11Nfm,pel2011a,peleska2009d}.
Furthermore, the generated result may be formally verified against the
model. This formal verification task is easier than proving the
correctness of a generator or compiler as a whole, because now just
one concrete artefact (the generated code) has to be checked against
the transformation source. The theoretical foundations of object code
verification, as well as its proof of concept have been established
in~\cite{Pnueli98}. In
\cite{RSRSChapter2012,DBLP:journals/fac/HaxthausenPK11} these concepts
have been refined and applied to the railway domain.


The  main advantage of this approach in comparison to performing V\&V for
generators and compilers is that the latter do not have to be
re-verified after improvements and extensions. Therefore we advocate
the test-based code verification approach to be applied in openETCS
for verifying generated high-level source code or object code of SIL-4
applications. 


The HW/SW integration testing is out of the scope of this
project. Nevertheless, Model-Based Testing of Compiled Object Code
or/and  Alternative Unit test on target HW may also be performed.


\subsubsection{Model Based Testing applied to Open ETCS V\&V}
According to the previous activity on defining the project process, 
the Open ETCS process is based on 3 main inputs for methodology and 
product lifecycle: the SCRUM methodology, the Model Driven Design and the
 Cenelec software development V cycle.
Traditionally, system requirements are directly translated into formal specifications
 on which verification and proof techniques are applied. The use of formal 
specifications and formal language allows then to derive the models using dedicated
 languages (B for instance) in order to guaranty conservation of properties along 
the design process. The main difficulty in this context is to be sure that the
 interpretation of rules has correctly been captured in the formalized specification
 which is not easy to check by the regulators. For this reason, the model based testing
 has been chosen as testing and verification technique within the V\&V activities of
 the OpenETCS project. 

Moreover, we suggest to create test models on the basis of the ETCS standard (subset 026) and
the existing high-level test suites made available in subset 076. The latter test cases should 
be feasible computations of the test model, so that the test model really creates a {\it superset}
of the existing test suite from subset 076.



This technique application will be explained in the following
 paragraphs through the description of different model-based testing tools: 
MaTeLo, Diversity and RT-tester. 



\subsubsection{Matelo Model Based Testing solution}
MaTeLo purpose is to generate test cases for systems whose expected usage and 
behavior are described by a probabilistic model. MaTeLo tool is based on its own test
 model called "usage model" and uses, among other characteristics, usage profiles for 
test case generation. This usage model describes the possibilities regarding the use of 
the soft (in our case; operating scenario) during its whole lifecycle. This usage model is
 performed thanks to a Matelo specific modeler, it allows to generate test cases that will 
then be plugged to the SUT which will be the software semi-formal model realized in the 
frame of WP3 activities.
MaTeLo has three main functionalities: test modeler, test cases generator and test campaign
 analyser. Even if MaTeLo is mainly a test case generation tool, we can consider that this
 tool performs also analysis for different reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item A test model can be considered as a development artifact the same way as a system
 model for example. So analysis on it could identify some ambiguous or erroneous points in
 test model (i.e. in the future test campaign) or in the specifications (because MaTeLo mode
l is built from system specifications).
\item Even whether test campaign analysis is mainly based on testing activities, analysis
 techniques have to be used as wellThe limit between a model to perform test and a model
 to perform analysis is not so obvious.
\end{itemize}

Because its test case generation is based on a model, MaTeLo belongs to the family of
 Model-Based Testing solutions. MaTeLo model basically uses Markov Chains to describe 
the test model of the SUT implemented for "Black Box Testing" in all xIL steps (MIL, SIL, PIL, HIL).
MaTeLo Usage Model edition facility allows for implementing test models that describe the use
 cases of the SUT completed with the tester point of view, and then, Matelo testing facility 
can generate automatically the test cases generated by the tool.
Thanks to the numerous validation steps, MaTeLo Test Campaign Analysis provides information
 such as test coverage (requirements, model) or reliability of the SUT.
Once the MaTeLo test model is performed and the testing strategy is defined with MaTeLo profiles
 faciulities, MaTeLo generates test cases. For that, MaTeLo Testor contains several test generation 
algorithms that can be used for different purposes. Different test case generators are based on a
 Usage profile approach, considering the occurrence probability of each model transition. Other are
 deterministic (most probable execution path, or all the transitions are covered). 
In the case of Open ETCS project, the SUT model is an on-board EVC, designed according to the 
SRS Subset 026. This specification itself is not sufficient to cover all functional aspects, and tests 
depend strongly on the operating rules to be considered on the observed track. The principle 
for the MaTeLo model would be to encompass all the possible states and transitions that can 
be considered in a well-defined perimeter (based on Subset026, signaling and exploitation
 rules to consider). Then, the test could be precisely defined by the usage profile to adapt 
it to a track oriented testing campaign.

\subsubsection{Diversity Model Based Testing solution}
DIVERSITY is a model based testing tool developed at CEA LIST. Its underlying technology is symbolic
 execution. Symbolic execution has been first defined for programs. The goal of this technique is
 to identify, for each possible execution of the program, the constraints to be satisfied in order to 
follow it. The main idea consists in executing the program, not for concrete numerical values but for 
symbolic parameters, and to characterize constraints on these parameters at each step of the execution.
 In that sens, DIVERSITY is a white box testing tool.
In the frame of the openETCS project we plan to use DIVERSITY to extract test cases from models 
defined in the first phases of the system design. Our goal is to extract test cases dedicated to
 abstract safety requirements. More precisely we focus on safety requirements dealing with 
communication between sub systems. For that purpose we will use the language of sequence 
diagrams extended with timing constraints to specify such requirements. With sequence diagrams,
 one may describe execution scenarios in terms of partially ordered message passing between 
subsystems. Message passing can be structured thanks to operators expressing sequencing, 
parallelism, choice, loop...  
It is possible to automatically analyze sequence diagrams with DIVERSITY in order to extract test
 cases. The originality is that, thanks to projection mechanisms, it is possible to extract test cases,
 not only for the entire system, but also for any sub systems composing it. Because of this mechanism, 
sub systems can be tested as soon as they are implemented, even though the entire system is 
not yet implemented. In such a process we perform a particular kind of unitary testing in which 
unit test cases are built according to the usage that will be made of the sub system in the entire
 system. In the frame of OpenETCS, this functionality could be useful in order to realize the unitary
 and modular tests.
The first step consists in defining a requirement model in the form of a sequence diagram or a
 Matelo Test scenario. The requirement model is analyzed with DIVERSITY in step 2. This analysis 
results on a so-called symbolic tree, who’s each path denotes a possible (symbolic) execution of
 the sequence diagram. Such trees may be theoretically infinite due to the possible occurrences
 of the "loop" operator of sequence diagrams. Therefore, DIVERSITY uses various stopping 
criteria to stop the computation (typically based on message coverage notions). 
The symbolic tree computed in step 2 characterizes executions of the whole system model. 
However, because testing the whole system may be complicated in terms of testing architecture, 
or simply because one wants to test some sub systems before the whole system is implemented, 
we offer a mechanism to extract symbolic trees for each distinguished sub system. This is based 
on so-called projection techniques. This operation is realized in step 3. In step 4, each identified 
sub system is tested thanks to a real time off-line testing algorithm.
Then, we can relate correctness of sub systems and correctness of the whole system by using a 
compositionality theorem.
The compositionality theorem expresses that, the conformance of each subsystems to all their 
projections guarantees the conformance of the whole system to the sequence diagram. A direct
 consequence is that any faults of the whole system can be discovered as a fault of at least one
 of its sub systems. This implies that testing the whole system mainly comes to test each of its 
sub systems after a short test integration phase testing that each sub system is correctly connected.
 We believe that such an approach will be very useful for ETCS systems which are by nature very 
distributed and thus hardly observable and controllable as a whole. The share of OBU EVC kernel
 in sub-system is the role of the SSRS model, and this refinement to diversity will be possible once
 this functional decomposition of the EVC will be released.

\subsubsection{Complementary use of the DIVERSITY and MaTeLo}
The use of the two tools can be done in a complementary way that would 
allow a more efficient test case set generation. 
MaTeLo would start from the test model, and generate automatically all the
 use cases that can be encountered in CBTC use. MaTeLo tool analyses the 
models as black box, and generates tests according to a stochastic approach. 
DIVERSITY will analyze these scenarios, based on a symbolic execution of the 
semi-formal SysML model (white box testing), in order to filter the tests generated
 by MaTeLo and to reduce the test case set.
As discussed in previous Sections, the two tools DIVERSITY and MaTeLo handle 
different kinds of models. The version of DIVERSITY that we will use in the project 
handles high level models in the form of sequence diagrams. Such models can be used 
to specify requirements on communication scenario between subsystems of a reference
 system under test. Models handled in MaTeLo are automata labeled by transfer functions
 and probabilities. Such models are useful to describe executable behaviors very close to
 the actual implementation, and based on operating scenarii. Clearly these two levels of 
modeling are useful in design processes of safety critical applications such as ETCS implementations,
 and can be combined in different ways for improving the test coverage of our EVC Software kernel.
 Indeed, ETCS systems have such a level of complexity, that it is difficult to describe them in a model
 straight from the requirements. Therefore, the refinements provided by two modeling levels are very
 helpful. Moreover, it is mandatory to maintain a good traceability between these two levels of modeling, 
in order to fulfill the safety requirements.
The complementarity of these tools takes place in some refinement processes in which high level 
requirements can be implemented into executable models. However, it is crucial to assess whether 
executable models correctly implement requirements. In practice this may be a difficult question
 because it requires to efficiently explore the executable model, which by nature is generally 
huge because it represents in a precise manner the functional behaviors of the actual implementation.
 In order to overcome this problem we plan to take benefits from the fact that executable 
models of ETCS will be described in the form of communicating executable models. This fact permits
 to see the model as a collection of communicating subsystems. This permits to take benefits of the 
compositional result described in the Diversity, and use it for white box testing (the internal behavior
 of functional modules and blocks defined in the kernel can then be precisely tested)..


\subsubsection{The RT-tester} 

The RT-Tester test automation tool, made by Verified
\cite{verified_website}, performs automatic test generation, test
execution and real-time test evaluation.  It supports different
testing approach such as unit testing, software integration testing
for component, hardware/software integration testing and system
integration testing.  The RT-Tester version  follows the
model-based testing approach \cite{Peleska2011} and
it provides the following features :
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated Test Case Generation 
\item Automated Test Data Generation 
\item Automated Test Procedure Generation 
\item Automated Requirement Tracing 
\item Test Management system 
\end{itemize}
Starting from a test model design with UML/SYML, the RT-tester fully
automatically generates test cases. They are then specified as test
data (sequences of stimuli with timing constraints) and used to
stimulate the SUT and run concurently with the generated test
oracles. The test procedure is the combination of the test oracles and
the SUT that can be compiled and executed.

The tool supports test cases/data generation for structural
testing. It automatically generates  reach statement coverage, branch coverage and
modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) as far as this is possible.
The test cases may all be linked to requirements ensuring a complete
requirement traceability. 
Additionally RT-tester may produce test cases/data from a LTL
formula, since a LTL formula describes a possible run of the model.

Taking advantage of SysML requirements diagram, the test cases and
test procedures are directly linked to the requirements. It is then
possible to perform test campaign guided by requirements.

Finally the tool may produce the documentation of tests for
certification purposes. For each test cases the following document are
produced :
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Test procedure}: that specifies  how one test case can be
  executed, its associated test data produced and how the SUT
  reactions are evaluated against the expected results.
\item {\em Test report}: that summarizes all relevant information
  about the test execution.
\end{itemize}

In \cite{brauer_efficient_2012}, a general approach  on how to qualify
model-based testing tool according to the standard ISO 26262 ad RTCA
DO178C has been proposed and applied with success to the RT-tester
tool. Following the same  approach compatibility with the CENELEC EN50128
may be easily done. 


\subsection{Characterisation of Formal Methods}

Based on rigorous mathematical notions, formal methods may be used
to describe software systems' requirements in an unambiguous way,
thus supporting precise communication between engineers.
%
Formally specified requirements can be checked for consistency and
completeness by appropriate tools;
also, compliance between different representation levels of
specification can be verified.
%
Formal methods allow one to check software properties like:

\begin{itemize}
\item Freedom from exceptions
\item Freedom from deadlock
\item Non-interference between different levels of criticality
\item Worst case resource usage (execution time, stack, \ldots)
\item Correct synchronous or asynchronous behaviour,
        including absence of unintended behaviour
\item Absence of run-time error
\item Consistency of a formal model
\item Correctness of a formal model
\end{itemize}


In order to subsume this variety of applications under a single
paradigm,
the DO-178C
considers a formal method to consist in applying a
formal {\em analysis} to a formal {\em model}.
%
Both analysis and model differs depending on the particular method.
%
For most methods, the model
is just identical to the source code; however, it may
also be e.g.\ a tool-internally generated abstract state space (used
in the Abstract Interpretation method, cf.\
Section~\ref{sec:Abstract Interpretation} below).
%
For most methods, analysis tools need human advice;
however, they may also be fully automatic (e.g.\ for 
Abstract Interpretation or Model Checking, cf.\
\ref{sec:Model Checking}).

\subsection{Formal Analysis Methods}
\label{sec:formal-analysis}

In this section we present
the three most common methods for formal analysis.
The foundation of these analysis
methods are well understood and they have been
applied to many practical problems.


\subsubsection{Abstract Interpretation}
\label{sec:Abstract Interpretation}

The abstract interpretation method
\cite{Cousot.Cousot.1976}
builds at every point of a given program a conservative\footnote{
        i.e.\ guaranteeing soundness
}
abstraction
of the set of \emph{all} possible states that may occur there
during any execution run. Such a representation is also called an 
\emph{over-approximation}, in the sense that it captures all possible
concrete behaviours of the program, while the abstraction might lead to 
consider states that cannot occur in a concrete execution.
%
Abstract interpretation 
determines particular effects of the program relevant for the
properties to be analysed, but does not actually execute it.
%
This allows one to statically determine dynamic properties of
infinite-state programs.
%
The main application is to check the absence of runtime errors, like
e.g.\ dereferencing of null-pointers, zero-divides,
and out-of-bound array accesses.
%
While conventional ad-hoc static analysis tools such as PCLint or \mbox{QA\cxx}
are well-tailored for quick, but incomplete analyses,
abstract-interpretation based tools while requiring more computation time, are
\emph{safe} in the sense that they guarantee that {\em all} potential
runtime errors are detected. On the other hand, such a tool might report 
spurious warnings, related to states that are included in the abstraction but
do not correspond to concrete executions. Such \emph{false alarms} can be
avoided to some extent by increasing the precision of the 
abstraction~\cite{Souyris.Delmas.2007},
at the expense of the computation time of the analysis. However,
%
human intervention is often required to improve the approximation accuracy
w.r.t.\ those program points where {\em false alarms}
have to be removed.


\subsubsection{Deductive Verification}
\label{sec:deduct-verif}
Deductive methods
\cite{Beckert.Marche.2010}
\cite{Ledinot.Pariente.2010}\nocite{Beckert.Marche.2010}\cite{Abrial1996}
\cite{Abrial2005}
perform mathematical proofs to establish formally specified properties
of a given program, thus providing rigorous evidence. Its primary use is to
verify functional properties of the program.
This method is based on the Hoare logic~\cite{Hoare.1969,Hoare.Wirth.1973},
or axiomatic semantics, in
which functions are seen as predicate transformers. In summary, a function
\texttt{f}
is given a state described by a given predicate $P$ and transforms 
it into a new state, described by another predicate $f(P)$.
In this context, the specification of \texttt{f} is given by a \emph{contract}, 
which defines the predicate $R$ that \texttt{f} requires from its callers and
the predicate $E$ that it ensures upon return. Verifying the implementation
against such a specification amounts to proving that for each $P$ such that
$P\Rightarrow R$ (i.e.\ that satisfies the requirement of \texttt{f}), then
$E\Rightarrow f(P)$ 
(i.e.\ the concrete final state is implied by what \texttt{f} ensures).

%
Tools based on deductive verification usually extract proof obligations 
from program code and property specifications and attempt to 
prove them, either automatically or interactively. Some tools are tightly
coupled to a given theorem prover such as Atelier B~\cite{atelierb} or Rodin~\cite{rodin}, while other such as Why3~\cite{why3} 
promote a cooperation across a wide range of provers.
%
In addition to the contracts of the function, it is often required to provided
additional annotations in order to be able to use deductive verification. In
particular, for each loop in the code, a suitable \emph{loop invariant} has
to be provided. A loop invariant is a property that is true when encountering
the loop for the first time and, if true at the beginning of a loop step, stays
true at the end of this step. From both hypotheses, it is then possible to
inductively conclude that the invariant is true for any number of step, and in
particular at the end of the loop. While it is possible to synthesize
automatically loop invariant in some simple cases, in particular thanks to
abstract interpretation, this activity must most of the time be done manually.

Similarly, some proof obligations are too complicated to be handled by automated
theorem provers, and must be discharged interactively via proof
assistants~\cite{coq,isabelle}. Deductive verification is thus much less
automated than abstract interpretation. On the other hand, it is much more
flexible for functional properties verification, in the sense that it can be
used to prove any property that can be expressed in the specification language
of the tool (usually any first-order logic property), while abstract
interpretation is limited to the properties that fit within the abstract setting
that has been chosen.

\subsubsection{Model Checking}
\label{sec:Model Checking}

Model checking
\cite{Clarke.Schlingloff.2001}\nocite{Robinson.Voronkov.2001}
explores all possible behaviours of a program to
determine whether a specified property is satisfied.
%
It is applicable only to programs with reasonable small state spaces;
the specifications are usually about temporal properties.
%
If a property is unsatisfied, a counter-example can be generated
automatically,
showing a use case leading to property violation.

Bounded Model checking \cite{biere_symbolic_1999} (BMC) is mainly used
for finding bugs more than proving properties.  The basic idea of BMC
is to find a counter-example-trace of a bounded length . The
transition relation of the system is
unrolled to a bounded length symbolically and check against a
propositional formula with a SAT or a SMT-solver. If the formula is
satisfiable, it exists a feasible path in the system that validate the
formula, the SAT solver returns a satisfying assignment that is
transformed into a counter-example. Otherwise the bound is increased
and the process is repeated. Some  more recent works 
\cite{bradley_sat-based_2011,McMillan-interpo-2003} add the use  of induction techniques and
interpolant to prove the properties.

\subsection{Correct by Construction Formal Methods}
\label{sec:correctbyconstr}


\subsubsection{Event B for system analysis}

\begin{comment}

\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Classical B for software development}

Classical B \cite{Abrial1996} is used for software development. It is supported by Atelier B from ClearSy\cite{atelierb}, a free partially open source tool. The B software development starts with software requirements usually expressed in a natural language document. Classical B uses a mathematical language suitable both to model the requirements and to write implementable code. In a first step called formal general designed, requirements are modeled into B specification modules. The correctness of this step is partially covered by proof and partially by human verification. Then in a second step called formal detailed design, B specification modules are refined by breaking down modules until the B model is fully implemented. The correctness of this step is entirely covered by proof.

A B module contains state data and treatments both abstract and concrete. Those data are based on integers, sets, relations and functions. The properties of data are expressed with classical first order predicates. The treatments, which are called operations, are expressed with substitutions, which may be abstract (for instance one may specify that some state variables become such that some predicate should hold), or concrete like mere statements (assignment, if, case, while). 

A B module should follow a refinement process. During this process, specification information is gradually added, design choices are made, and eventually code is written by breaking down the module in other modules. The refinement consistency is handled by dedicated proof obligations, generated by the tool. Those proof obligations should be proved using specific proof tools: some automatic provers try to discharge proof obligations and when they fail, the user should help to build a demonstration in the interactive prover.

During the proof activity of large models, the model should be tuned to build a complete and consistent model where everything should fit together. Through this process, the user becomes aware of the precise properties needed to satisfied every part of the model.

In the end, B model code is translated into C or Ada code by automatic translator tools. This translation is basically a syntax transformation. However, as translating is here safely critical, usually 2 independent tools are used.

With classical B, the strength of a consistent and fully proved model is so high that it gives a very  high level of trust in the code obtained. The proof activity makes it useless to go through a unit test activity, since symbolic proof covers all possible use of each operation, whereas unit tests only cover a limited number of cases.

\subsubsection{B predicate evaluation for data verification and validation}

\end{comment}


\subsection{Verification with Formal Methods}

In the railway domain, the standard
EN~50128 highly recommends use of formal methods in
requirements specification (\cite[Table A.2]{en50128}),
software architecture (A.3),
software design and implementation (A.4),
verification and testing (A.5),
data preparation (A.11), and
modelling (A.17)
for Safety Integrity Level SIL~3 and above.
%
However, functional\slash black-box testing is still mandatory in
verification; this constraint may be considered as discouraging from
the use of formal methods.

Until recently, the situation was quite similar in the aerospace
domain.
%
J.\ Joyce, a member of the RTCA
standardisation committee SC-205, described
Airbus' problems in certifying their ``unit-proof for unit-test''
approach:

        \begin{quote}
        ``{\em Formal methods were used for certification credit in
        development of the A380, but apparently it was not a trivial
        matter to persuade certification authorities that this was
        acceptable even with the reference to formal methods in
        DO-178B as an alternative method.}''
        \end{quote}


Such experiences eventually caused the more detailed treatment of
formal method issues in the revision C of DO-178 that appeared in
late 2011.
%
The DO-178C considers formal methods as special cases of
reviews and analyses; thus incorporating them without major
structural changes of the software development recommendations.
%
For an employed formal method, the standard requires to justify its
unambiguity, its soundness\footnote{
        i.e., that the method never asserts a property to be true
        when it actually may be not true
},
and any additional assumptions\footnote{
        e.g.\ data range limits
}
needed by the method.
%
The DO-178C admits formal property verification on object code
as well as on source code, the latter additionally needing
evidence about property preservation of the source-to-object
code compiler.
%
However, ``{\em functional tests
executed in target hardware are always required to ensure that the
software in the target computer will satisfy the high-level requirements}''
\cite[FM.12.3.5]{DO-333}.

As a consequence of subsuming formal methods under general reviews and
analyses, no deviating special rules to qualify tools are necessary:
``{\em
Any tool that supports the formal analysis should be assessed under
the tool qualification
guidance required by DO-178C and qualified where necessary.}''
\cite[FM.1.6.2]{DO-333}.
Of course, for the railway domain, the rules of EN~50128 for supporting
software tools and languages must be taken into account
\cite[Section~6.7]{en50128}.

During the last 15 years, formal methods have grown out of academic
playgrounds and become practically relevant in several applications
domains.
Below, we sketch a few different tools, also to indicate the variety
of issues formal methods can be applied for.
Many of the tools mentioned below provide formal verification for programs
written in~C.
There is currently insufficient support for the programming language~\cxx,
which is predominantly used in Thales' RBC product.
%
A list of free software tools for formal verification
can be found at \cite{gulliver}.
%
The list is not meant to be complete.
%
It is structured by tool purpose, and each tool is briefly
introduced.

\subsubsection{The Frama-C Source Code Analysis Suite}
\label{sec:Frama-C}

{\em Frama-C}~\cite{Cuoq.2012} is a suite of tools 
from CEA LIST and INRIA Saclay, dedicated to the analysis of C source code.
Frama-C gathers several static analysis techniques in a single
collaborative framework. Frama-C also features a formal specification language,
ACSL~\cite{ACSL}, in which the contract of each function of the program can
be written (see section~\ref{sec:deduct-verif}), as well as assertions that
are supposed to hold at a given program point.

Frama-C's kernel as well as many analysis plug-ins are available under the
LGPL Open-Source licence from~\cite{frama-c}. Other plug-ins have been
developed by third-party developers, either in an academic~\cite{Bouajjani.2011}
or an industrial~\cite{Ledinot.Pariente.2010} background. The remainder of this
section only deals with the plugins that are released with Frama-C's kernel and
are the most relevant for OpenETCS.

\paragraph{Value Analysis} 
Value analysis is based on abstract interpretation 
(section~\ref{sec:Abstract Interpretation}). This plugin analyses a
complete application, starting from a given entry point, and gives at
each program point an over-approximation of the values that can appear
in each memory location at this point. For each operation, Value also
checks that whether the abstract value of the operands guarantees that
the operation is safe. If this is not the case, it emits an alarm, in
the form of an ACSL assertion, and attempts to reduce its abstract
state to represent only safe concrete values. If all concrete values
are unsafe, then either the corresponding branch of the code is dead
(and was only taken because of the over-approximation), or there is a
real error in the code. Otherwise, the analysis resumes with the
reduced state. Conversely, if no alarm is emitted by Value, the
analysed code is guaranteed not to lead to a run-time error.

Value can also be used to check whether ACSL annotations hold or
not. However, it is restricted to the subset of the ACSL language that
fits well within the abstract representation that is used.

Finally, Value can be tweaked in various ways to increase the
precision of the results (leading to fewer false alarms), generally at
the expense of the computation time and amount of memory used by the
analysis. These options are described in more detail in Value's
reference manual~\cite{frama-c-va}.

\paragraph{WP} 
WP is a plugin dedicated to deductive verification 
(see section~\ref{sec:deduct-verif}). It uses different models 
to represent C memory states in the logic. More abstract models lead to easier
proof obligations, but cannot be used in presence of low-level pointer 
arithmetic, while more concrete ones are able to deal with any C construction,
at the expense of far more complex proof obligations.

WP has two native interfaces to discharge proof obligations. The first one calls
the Alt-Ergo~\cite{alt-ergo} automated theorem prover, while the second let the
user do the proof within the Coq~\cite{coq} interactive proof assistant. In
both cases, the original formulas are first run through an internal simplifier,
that can directly discharge the simplest proof obligations, without the need
for a call to an external tool. In addition, WP can also call the
Why3~\cite{why3} back-end, through which it has access to a
variety of automated provers. Alt-Ergo, Coq and Why3 are available
under Open-Source licences (Cecill-C and LGPL). The various possible settings
of WP are described in its user manual~\cite{WP}.

While WP's primary usage is to prove functional properties expressed as 
function contracts, it can also be used to prove the absence of runtime error,
either by discharging the alarms emitted by Value Analysis, or by generating
proof obligations for all operations that might lead to a runtime error 
(without having to use Value first). The latter case is done through the use
of the \emph{RTE} plugin, that generates an ACSL assertion for each potentially
dangerous operation. WP can then generate proof obligations for these assertions
as usual.

\paragraph{Aoraï}
While Value and WP are used to verify program properties, the Aoraï plugin is
dedicated to generate ACSL specifications (which can then be proved by Value
or WP). More precisely, it takes as input an automaton describing the sequence
of function calls that are allowed during the execution of a program (from a
given entry point). From that automaton, Aoraï instruments the code and provides
ACSL contract for each function so that if all the contracts hold, then the
code is behaving according to the automaton.

Transitions of the automaton can be guarded by conditions over the state of the
program at a given call point. Full syntax of Aoraï's input language is 
described in~\cite{aorai}.




\subsubsection{The Diversity Symbolic Execution Tool}


DIVERSITY is a symbolic execution tool developed at $CEA-LIST$. Its underlying technology is {\em symbolic execution}.  Symbolic execution has been first defined for programs \cite{King75,Clarke,Rama}. The goal of this technique is to identify, for each possible execution of the program, the constraints to be satisfied in order to follow it.  
The main idea consists in executing the program, not for concrete numerical values but for symbolic parameters, and to characterize constraints on those parameters at each step of the execution. 
For instance let us consider that at a given step of an execution the next instruction $ins$ to be executed is $if(x>14) x:=x+1$. Moreover let us suppose that from the previous steps we have computed a couple $(x\rightarrow a, a<45)$ meaning that before the execution of $ins$, the  value of $x$ is represented by the symbolic parameter $a$, with the constraint that $a<45$. Executing $ins$ results on a new context $(x\rightarrow a+1 , a<45 \land a>14)$ taking into account both the constraints so that the instruction is executable ($x$ has to be greater than $14$ and since $x$ value is $a$ it means that $a$ has to be greater than $14$) and the variable updates induced by the instruction (the result of the execution of $x:=x+1$ is that $x$ value is now $a+1$). $a<45 \land a>14$ is called a {\em path
  condition}. Generating test data to follow some executions comes the to use solvers to find values satisfying such path conditions. 
Symbolic execution has been later adapted to modeling formalisms like {\em Input Output Symbolic Transition Systems} (\cite{RGLG03,GAL00}), later to timed version of Input Output Symbolic Transition Systems (\cite{EGL11,BEGL12}) and also to various industrial modeling languages like the {sequence diagrams} of the $UML$ (\cite{BGS11}). Those symbolic execution adaptations have been used in model based testing contexts. System under test are compared to their models by means of two conformance relations namely {\em $ioco$} (\cite{Tre96a}) and its timed extension {\em $tioco$} (\cite{Kri04}). Those two conformance relations are among the most widely accepted conformance relations. Several testing algorithms were defined based on those conformance relations (\cite{GLRT06, EGL11, BEGL12}).

In the frame of the openETCS project we plan to use DIVERSITY to extract test cases from models defined in the first phases of the system design. Our goal is to extract test cases dedicated to abstract safety requirements. More precisely we focus on safety requirements  dealing with communication between sub systems. For that purpose we will use the language of sequence diagrams extended with timing constraints to specify such requirements. With sequence diagrams, one may describe execution scenarios in terms of partially ordered message passing between subsystems. Message passing can be structured thanks to powerful operators expressing sequencing, parallelism, choice, loop...   
In \cite{BGS11} we show how to automatically analyze such sequence diagrams with DIVERSITY in order to extract test cases. The originality is that is that, thanks to projection mechanisms, it is possible to extract test cases, not only for the entire system, but also for any of its distinguished sub systems. Thanks to this mechanism, sub systems can be tested as soon as they are implemented, even though the entire system is not yet implemented. In such a process we perform a particular kind of unitary testing in which unit test cases are built according to the usage that will be made of the sub system in the entire system. 
Faults identified with such an approach are very relevant because we know that they will be activated in the system. The process is illustrated in Figure \ref{ct}.
The first step consists in defining a requirement model in the form of a sequence diagram. The requirement model is analyzed with DIVERSITY in step $(2)$. This analysis results on a so-called {\em symbolic tree}, whose each path denotes a possible (symbolic) execution of the sequence diagram. 
Such trees may be theoretically infinite due to the possible occurrences of the "loop" operator of sequence diagrams. Therefore, DIVERSITY uses various stopping criteria to stop the computation (typically based on message coverage notions). 
The symbolic tree computed in step $(2)$ characterizes executions of the whole system model. However because testing the whole system may be complicated in terms of testing architecture, or simply because one wants to test some sub systems before the whole system is implemented, we offer a mechanisms to extract symbolic trees for each distinguished sub system. This is based on so-called {\em projection} techniques (\cite{FGG07,EGL11}). This operation is realized in step $(3)$. In step $(4)$ Each identified sub system is tested thanks to a real time off-line testing algorithm (\cite{BEGL12}).
Thanks to a compositionality theorem (\cite{bannour2012}) we can relate correctness of sub systems and correctness of the whole system (see step $5$).
The compositionality theorem expresses that, the conformance of each subsystems to all their projections guarantees the conformance of the whole system to the sequence diagram. A direct consequence is that any faults of the whole system can be discovered as a fault of at least one of its sub systems. This implies that testing the whole system mainly comes to test each of its sub systems regardless of a very simple test integration phase in which one only tests that each sub system is correctly connected. We believe that such an approach will be very useful for ETCS systems which are by nature very distributed and thus hardly observable and controllable as a whole. We plan to identify with experts how to partition them into several sub systems that will be more easily observable and controllable at the testing phase.

\subsubsection{Formal Verification of Real-Time Aspects based on Timed Automata}
\label{sct:twt:descrTA}

%\textcolor{magenta}{===== Start TWT =====}

Verifying system properties involving time is difficult with traditional model checking methods. Commonly used \emph{temporal logics}, such as LTL or CTL catch discrete and qualitative aspects of time and allow to formulate properties such as\footnote{The prefixes are the corresponding linear time operators.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\bf X] At the next point in time a property holds.
  \item[\bf F] At some future point in time a property holds.
  \item[\bf G] Always/generally (now and at any future point in time) a property holds.
  \item[\bf U] A property $p$ holds until a property $q$ holds.
\end{itemize}

While it is possible to state properties that must be satisfied at individual (discrete) points in time, continuous and quantitative aspects of time as in the safety requirement
\begin{quote}
``The delay between receiving an emergency message and the issuing of a brake order is less than 1 second.''
\end{quote}
are a real challenge. The problem does not stem from discrete vs. continuous time, as any physical realisation of a real-time system is inherently discretised by its clock. Instead, an operator for expressing arbitrary temporal quantities or differences is missing. Thus, for LTL and a clock of 1 kHz, it would be required to use the operator \textbf{X} 1000 times. This notation is rather unhandy, as it enforces to express a functional property relative to a particular system.


This lack of expressivity is not merely a matter of notation, i.e., LTL or CTL, but also of the underlying semantics. Before introducing a better suited logic we will first consider a formalism that serves as this logic’s semantics -- namely \emph{timed automata}.

\paragraph{Timed Automata}

Timed automata \cite{Alur1994} are essentially finite automata extended with a finite set of clocks that all proceed at the same rate. Clocks may be individually reset to zero. Clock variables can be part of constraint expressions that may be used as transition guards. A transition can only be taken if its guard is fulfilled. Similarly, it is possible to specify an invariant for a state that must be satisfied when the automaton is in this state. Thus, we can enforce time constraints for the runs of the automaton.

\paragraph{An Example}
The timed automaton in Figure~\ref{fig:ta:emergency1} depicts an automaton representing an over-simplified version of an OBU subsystem processing emergency messages. It has three states, one clock $x$ and three actions, \textit{emg\_msg} (reception of an emergency message), \textit{proc\_msg} (processing the message, e.g. raising an alarm) and \textit{brake} (issueing the brake order). Upon receiving an emergency message the clock $x$ is reset. The \textit{proc\_msg}-transition is guarded by the clock constraint $x<1$ preventing the transition to be taken if $x\geq 1$. The same holds for the \textit{brake}-transition. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.3cm,bend angle=45,auto]
\node [state, initial] (s1) at (0,0) { wait };
\node [state] (s2) at (4,0) { rcvd };
\node [state] (s3) at (8,0) { prcd };
\path[->] (s1) edge node {$\mathit{emg\_msg}, x:=0$}(s2);
\path[->] (s2) edge node {$x<1, \mathit{proc\_msg}$}(s3); 
\path[->] (s3) edge [bend left] node {$x<1, \mathit{brake}$}(s1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{First (faulty) version of a timed automaton for processing emergency messages}
\label{fig:ta:emergency1}
\end{figure}

One might think that the automaton from Figure~\ref{fig:ta:emergency1} thus fulfills the safety requirement stated above. Due to the operational semantics of timed automata this is not true: a timed automaton in a given state can either take a transition or wait for an arbitrary amount of time. Thus, if automaton waits in state rcvd and $x$ exceeds one second, the system will deadlock as the next transition is guarded by the constraint $x<1$. A run of the automaton that could serve as counterexample is, e.g.

$$(\mathrm{wait},0)\rightarrow(\mathrm{wait},0.5)\rightarrow(\mathrm{rcvd},0.5)\rightarrow(\mathrm{rcvd},2)\rightarrow\textrm{DEADLOCK}$$

A solution to this problem is to force the automaton to proceed by placing \emph{progress} constraints on the states. This has been done in Figure~\ref{fig:ta:emergency2}. The transition guards have been omitted as they are not necessary anymore. Now the safety property ``The delay between receiving an emergency message and the issuing of a brake order is less than 1 second.'' is fulfilled.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.3cm,bend angle=45,auto]
\node [state, initial] (s1) at (0,0) { wait };
\node [state] (s2) at (4,0) { rcvd }; 
\node [state] (s3) at (8,0) { prcd };
\node at (4,-0.7) {$x<1$};
\node at (8,-0.7) {$x<1$};
\path[->] (s1) edge node {$\mathit{emg\_msg}, x:=0$}(s2);
\path[->] (s2) edge node {$\mathit{proc\_msg}$}(s3); 
\path[->] (s3) edge [bend left] node {$\mathit{brake}$}(s1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Corrected version of the timed automaton for processing emergency messages}
\label{fig:ta:emergency2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{UPPAAL}

\textsc{Uppaal} is a tool for modelling and verifying timed automata developed by the universities of Uppsala and Aalborg \cite{UppaalTutorial04}. This toolkit is under constant development and comes with an academic as well as a commercial licence. Moreover, there is a comparably large body of literature featuring \textsc{Uppaal}, providing introductory and industrial examples. 

\textsc{Uppaal} extends timed automata with synchronisation enabling concurrent, communicating automata representing different parts of a system. In addition, variables other than clocks are supported making the modelling language more powerful. The logic used for expressing real-time properties is a subset of TCTL (Timed Computation Tree Logic). Nesting of temporal operators is not supported leading to a restriction in expressiveness.

\paragraph{From SysML/UML to Timed Automata}

Timed automata and statecharts in SysML/UML are both based on the concept of finite automata. Thus, it seems reasonable to extract timed automata from existing statecharts which is addressed in the literature \cite{David2002, Knapp2002, Jensen2004}. In this way, safety properties -- formalised as TCTL formulae -- can be verified in an automated fashion for a given statechart. However, there remain challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item Translating hierarchical states to timed automata is not straight-forward and complicates matters significantly. If an hierarchical state-chart is flattened, structural information is lost and makes the timed automaton more difficult to read and understand. Thus, it is advisable to retain some kind of hierarchy, possibly by using synchronisation mechanisms.
\item Special statechart features, such as history nodes that have a partially undefined semantics according to the current SysML/UML standard \cite{fecher_29_2005}, introduce problems. As they are not used very often, they can possibly left out in a first iteration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification with Model-Based Simulation}
\label{sct:uro:systemc}

%\textcolor{magenta}{===== Start URO (first draft) =====}

This section addresses verification based on simulation. By building an executable model of system components its real-time behaviour can by analysed and evaluated before actually building the entire system.

\subsubsection{Modelling with SysML and SystemC}

Specifications in natural language are difficult to handle. Breaking down an overall system description into small comprehensible parts reduces complexity and eases interdisciplinary communication to be more efficient in performing development tasks.

SysML, developed by the OMG (Object Management Group), is a simple but powerful general-purpose graphical modeling language that does not directly support executable models. However, there is a variety of tools for code generation from UML/SysML, especially for the Eclipse platform and the Papyrus framework that will be used in the project.

To enable model execution and especially real-time simulation it is considered to generate semi-formal SystemC code from that abstract SysML models. It has to be investigated whether the the SysML model have to be adapted to a domain or language specific version. Concrete analysis will show whether this is feasible.

SystemC is a C++ library providing an event-driven simulation interface suitable for electronic system design at various abstraction levels (from high level down to individual hardware components). It enables a system designer to simulate concurrent processes. SystemC processes can communicate in a simulated real-time environment, using channels of different datatypes (all C++ types and user defined types are supported). SystemC supports hardware and software synthesis (with the corresponding tools). SystemC models are executable.

\subsubsection{Model execution and simulation}

The aim of the execution of an SystemC model is to ensure that the working capacity (performance) of the underlying hardware system is sufficient to meet the system requirements. It has to be analysed which hardware resources will be needed for the OBU to avoid excessive delays and to ensure adequate response times in critical situations.  Because of the integrated simulation enviroment, SystemC enables scheduling analysis for average and worst-case conditions and provides analyses of process resources for individual system functions.

In addition, by creating an executable system model from SysML or UML, the (real time) behaviour of the system can be analysed which is not feasible at the SysML level.

\subsubsection{Task}
\label{sec:ssrs-verif-task}

The SSRS (sub-system requiement specification) outlines the subsystem
which is going to be modeled within the project. The SSRS describes
the architecture of the subsystem (functions and their I/O) and the
requirements allocated to these functions. If necessary, the
requirements are rewritten in order to address the I/O and to
correspond to the allocation. It also provides the classification into
vital and non vital requirements and data
streams. The architecture part is described in a semi-formal language,
and the requirements are described in natural language.

The SSRS is to be viewed as a supplement to the SS-026 and the
TSIs and is not intended to replace them. The verification has to
check that a complete and consistent set of functionalities have been
identified and that the architecture is adequate.

please go to the mentioned section.

\subsubsection{Software Verification}
\label{sec:sw-verif}

This section describes software verification activities in greater detail than the description above. This presentation of the material shall be unified in due course.

The SW process is detailed in the D.2.3 OpenETCS process. Bearing in mind that the tasks described in this openETCS Verification plan are strongly linked to the Software process defined in that document, the following figure is included in order to have present the key points to be covered in the plan.

\textbf{SW Requirements Verification}

\underline{Task} 

In the SW Requirements Specification the SSRS shall be taken as starting point, redefining it to ensure the software constraints are considered. 
The SW Requirements Verification phase then shall verify that the proposed Software Requirements cover as much as possible of the SSRS and provide a correct implementation of the System Requirements in the Software context.
On the other hand, the Verification done in this phase shall include the assessment of the SW Requirements modelling, the objective is to ensure the representation of the requirements is coherent with their specification as well as complete, explicit and implementable, as well as traceable to the semi-formal and/or formal models defined in the system phase.

\underline{Documents to Be Produced} 

\begin{itemize}
\item SW Requirements Verification Report
\end{itemize}

\underline{Activities}

Some activities shall be performed to ensure the requirements are written in a readable and testable manner. The Verification of the Software Requirements shall assess whether the requirements met the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Deterministic: Given an initial system state and a set of inputs, you must be able to predict exactly what the outputs will be.
\item Unambiguous: All openETCS project members must get the same meaning from the requirements; otherwise they are ambiguous.
\item Correct: The relationships between causes and effects are described correctly.
\item Complete: All requirements are included. There are no omissions.
\item Non-redundant: Just as the Software modelling (semi-formal and formal) provides a non-redundant set of data, the requirements should provide a non-redundant set of functions and events.
\item Lends itself to change control: Requirements, like all other deliverables of the openETCS project, should be placed under change control.
\item Traceable: SW Requirements must be traceable to each other, to the SSRS, to the objectives, to the design, to the test cases, and to the code.
\item Readable by all project team members: The project stakeholders, including the users, experts and testers, must each arrive at the same understanding of the requirements.
\item Written in a consistent style: Requirements should be written in a consistent style to make them easier to understand.
\item Explicit: Requirements must never be implied.
\item Logically consistent: There should be no logic errors in the relationships between causes and effects.
\item Lends itself to reusability: Good requirements can be reused on future projects based on openETCS.
\item Succinct: Requirements should be written in a brief manner, with as few words as possible.
\item Annotated for criticality: Each SW requirement should note the level of criticality to the openETCS project. In this way, the priority of each requirement can be determined, and the proper amount of
emphasis placed on developing and testing each requirement.
\item Feasible: If the software design is not capable of delivering the requirements, then the requirements are not feasible.
\end{itemize}

The activities that shall ensure these aspects are successfully met are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act1. Compliance with SSRS}: the SW Requirements are based on the SSRS, so it shall be ensured that their specification is compliant and coherent with regard to the SSRS; the SW requirements complement, adjust and enlarge the scope delimited by the SSRS in the Software phase.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act2. Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness, Correctness assurance}: A significant problem with recording requirements as text is the difficulty of analyzing them for completeness, consistency, and correctness. The Specification of the SW Requirements has precise syntactic and semantic rules (e.g., data type consistency) and the specification of the requirements shall be compared against those established rules to ensure these aspects are correctly covered.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act3. Testability assurance}: The two objectives for testing the openETCS safety-critical SW are the demonstration that the software satisfies its requirements and the demonstration that errors that could lead to unacceptable failures have been removed.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act4. Verificability assurance}: The SW Requirements shall identify the main functionality and describe the functional breakdown and data flows from top-level functions to low-level functions. The description provided as well as the flows identified shall be verifiable.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act5. Compliance with Standards}: Compliance with CENELEC Standards (EN50126, EN50128 and EN50129) shall be verified.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act6. Traceability with SSRS}: Each SSRS allocated to software must map to one or more software requirement. Traceability analysis, which can be automated, determines the completeness of the mapping of SSRS to software. A table similar to this one shall be obtained, either manually or automatically to assess the conformance with this expected activity.
\item {\it SWReq-Ver-Act7. Requirements modelling correctness}: Considering  "the result of the modelling activities is a document that represents a thorough understanding of the problem the proposed software is intended to solve"\textcolor{red}{[1. Cho, Chin-Kuei, Quality Programming, John Wiley \& Sons, Inc, 1987, p 21.]}, during the SW Requirements verification, it shall be possible to capture all required information, including additional information for safety-critical aspects with the support of the models. These Requirements representations shall be compared to their original specification and assess whether they are complete and enough to cover all the information provided by them.

\textbf{SW Architecture, Design and Modelling Verification}

\underline{Task} 

This phase aims to ensure that the software architecture design
adequately fulfils the software requirements specification already
verified in the SW Requirements Verification phase. 
The software architecture defines the major elements and subsystems of
the openETCS software, how they are interconnected, and how the
required (safety integrity) attributes will be achieved. It also
defines the overall behaviour of the software, and how the software
elements interact.  
To carry this phase the information from the current software
lifecycle phase shall be verified. All essential information should be
available and must be verified; the information should include the
adequacy of the specifications, design and plans in the current phase.  
The architecture and design shall be modelled and the coherence of
those models with regard to their specification shall be verified to
assess whether the constraints are correctly treated. 
The verification configuration should be precisely defined and the
verification activities shall be repeatable. 

\underline{Documents to Be Produced} 

\begin{itemize}
\item SW Architecture, Design and Modelling Verification Report
\end{itemize}

\underline{Activities}

Software architecture verification should consider whether the
software architecture design adequately fulfils the SW requirements
specification.  

The essential properties to be verified during this phase are:

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the software supposed to do: including the SW specification and the system capabilities
\item What is the software not supposed to do: be aware of the
  unexpected emergent behaviour, boundary specifications, inhibits 
\item What is the software supposed to do under adverse conditions: system biases, tolerances
\item What are the safety considerations
\item What are the integration or interfacing considerations:
  subsystems, modules, components, relationship between hardware and
  software, partitions, parallelism, compatibility 
\item What are the dependability considerations: performance, capacity, complexity, stability
\end{itemize}

Considering these aspects, a table shall be prepared to list a
relation of verification dimensions regarding to the Architecture and
Design that facilitates the process. An example is given below:

The software architecture modelling, which consists of determining and
connecting software components, requires a phase of analysis to be
able to validate the representation carried out, as errors can occur
in the representation. It is thus necessary to be able to identify and
to provide them to the designer.  

Modelling must also bring answers in term of feasibility and the constraint shall be analyzed so 
the interdependent functions should not overlap.

The verifications done at the software architecture level are related to specification and execution model coherency.

The expected activities for this phase are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it SWArch-Ver-Act1. Check the software architecture design}:
  The SW architecture and design should fulfil the SW requirements
  specification. From a safety point of view, the software
  architecture phase is where the basic safety strategy for the
  software is developed. 
\item {\it SWArch-Ver-Act2. Handle attributes}: The attributes of
  major elements and subsystems should be adequate with reference to
  the feasibility of the safety performance required, testability for
  further verification, readability by the development and
  verification team, and safe modification to permit further
  evolution. With the attributes, on which we rely once the software
  is specified, it is possible to check if the model of execution and
  the coherence of the periods of the various software components are
  corrects. 
\item {\it SWArch-Ver-Act3. Check incompatibilities}: The
  incompatibilities between design and specification should be
  checked.  
\item {\it SWArch-Ver-Act4. Model coherency}: Verify the
  representation carried out with the modelling. The errors identified
  can be related to the symmetry of the inter-connected functions. A
  certain number of constraints of coherence must thus be analyzed.  
\item {\it SWArch-Ver-Act5. Constraints analysis}: Ensure system
  dysfunctions do not occur. Some components can also execute an
  operation depending on a signal resulting from another component,
  which results in constraints of synchronization that must also be
  taken into account.  

\end{itemize}

\underline{Tools, Techniques, Methods and Measures} 

The specific software tools, techniques, and methodologies to be
employed by the verification team are to be identified here. 
The purpose of each should be defined and plans for the acquisition, training, support, and qualification of each shall be described in this section.

\textbf{SW Component and Modelling Verification}

\underline{Task} 

This phase analyzes whether the SW components defined in the openETCS Software process are verifiable by design, with a focus on the formal verification of data aspects of components and components modelling. 
This task requires a detailed understanding not only of the corresponding specification, but also the environments and methodology in which the verification component will be used.

This phase delivers methods and tools to

\begin{itemize}
\item Verify the component models by model-checking techniques, with a
  focus on behavioural aspects such as attributes and data-dependent
  properties 
\item Verify the specification of the components is coherent to the SW
  architecture and design previously verified. This activity shall be
  based on the existing models in the component stage as well as
  previous phases, in close connection with the model checking
  activities. 
\end{itemize}

\underline{Documents to Be Produced} 

\begin{itemize}
\item SW Component and Modelling Verification Report
\end{itemize}

\underline{Activities}

This phase aims to assess whether the specification and modelling of components are reusable, configurable, and implementable in the expected code automatically generated environment. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Within the context of the models that contain the components identified for the SW phase, the verification of components within a control system model shall be required. 
As standalone components — For a high level of confidence in the component algorithm, verify the component in isolation from the rest of the components and sub-systems identified. This approach is called component analysis.
\item Verifying standalone components provides several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis can be be used to focus on portions of the design that cannot be tested because of the physical limitations of the system being controlled.
\item This approach can be used for open-loop simulations to test the plant model without feedback control.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The components shall be identified at the points of minimal coupling (minimal control and/or information exchange) and decompose the specification. The smaller components might be amenable to be verified and how to abstract these parts of the specification shall be analysed. 

The rest of the specification could be exposed to formal analysis, such as model checking or theorem proving. The abstraction reduces the number of states that need to be checked by an automated verification technique and helps in avoiding the state explosion problem, which occurs in traditional model checking.

An approach to specification decomposition is slicing the system specifications represented with Petri Nets. In this way, the specification shall improve the understanding of the complexity of the system and high-risk components can be identified earlier. 

The activities that shall ensure these aspects are successfully met are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it SWComp-Ver-Act1. Verify components with minimal coupling independently of the model}: Within this activity a component analysis shall be performed to verify model blocks, atomic subsystems and statechart atomic subcharts. After extracting the blocks, or contents of the subsystems and subcharts, a harness model shall be created for the referenced model and the extracted model with the contents of the subsystem o subchart. A Test suite shall be prepared and executed to record coverage and output values. The Code Generation Verification (CGV) shall be invoked to execute the test cases on the generated code for the model that contains the component.
\item {\it SWComp-Ver-Act2. Verify components with minimal coupling in the context of the model}: A similar process shall be conducted in this case but performing a system analysis to verify the model blocks in the context of the model.   
\item {\it SWComp-Ver-Act3. Formal analysis of components}: Perform model checking of components against properties; the results obtained shall highlight that: the component satisfies the properties for the environment; the component violates the properties for
the environment; characterization of those environments in which the components
satisfied each property.
\end{itemize}

Regarding the Modeling Verification, the activities involved shall ensure that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The models have been designed correctly and covers all the parts involved in the openETCS project
\item The algorithms have been implemented properly
\item The models do not contain errors, oversights, or bugs
\item The specification is complete and that mistakes have not been made in implementing the model
\end{itemize}

Each of the models defined in the full development context shall be developed for a specific purpose and its validity is determined with respect to that purpose. It shall be considered that a model that may be valid for one set of conditions, can be invalid in another; because of that, the model’s output variables of interest shall be clearly identified and their required amount of accuracy be specified. 

It is costly and time consuming to determine whether a model is valid over the complete domain of the full development context. Instead, tests and evaluations are conducted until sufficient confidence and certainty is obtained that a model can be considered valid. In the model verification activities, tests are performed, errors are identified, and corrections are made to the underlying models while the models are exercised for the identified cases. Furthermore, the verification of the models can result in retesting requirements to ensure code integrity.

If the verification process determines that a model does not have sufficient accuracy for any one of the sets of identified conditions, then the model is invalid. However, determining that a model has sufficient accuracy for numerous conditions does not guarantee that a model is valid everywhere in its applicable domain. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it SWModel-Ver-Act1.} 
\item {\it SWModel-Ver-Act2. }  
\item {\it SWModel-Ver-Act3. }
\end{itemize}

The specific software tools, techniques, and methodologies to be

\textbf{SW code generation Verification}

\underline{Task} 

This phase analyzes whether the generated code from the model is correct, robust, complete, coherent and reliable, with a focus on the formal verification and on the equivalence of the model and the generated code. 

This phase delivers methods and tools to

\begin{itemize}
\item Verify the equivalence between the model and the generated code by equivalence testing and dynamic testing techniques
\item Verify the correctness of the translation algorithm and its implementation
\item Verify the complexity, coding guidelines and syntax of the generated code by static analysis techniques
\end{itemize}

\underline{Documents to Be Produced} 

\begin{itemize}
\item SW Code Generation Verification Report
\end{itemize}

\underline{Activities}

When in the other phase the confidence in the correctness of the model has been verified, it is necessary to have high confidence in the generated code.

To achieve verified code generation, it is not sufficient
to only verify the code generation algorithm due to the implementation of the algorithm might introduce errors as well. It is necessary to distinguish between the correctness of the translation algorithm itself and the
correctness of its implementation.

Within the context of the Code Generation Verification, the code generation verification approach shall utilize translation testing to demonstrate
that the execution semantics of the model are preserved during production
code generation, compilation and linking

The validity of the translation process, i.e. whether or not the semantics
of the model have been preserved during code generation, compilation and linking, shall be determined by comparing the system reactions

The activities that shall ensure these aspects are successfully met are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act1. Semantic Properties Verification}: For safety reasons, it is necessary that the generated code is semantically equivalent to the original model specification to ensure correct software and system behavior.


\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act2. Quality Properties (Complexity, Syntax, coding guidelines) Verification }:  
\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act3. Equivalence verification}: 
\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act4. }:  
\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act5.  }:  
\item {\it SWCode-Ver-Act6.  }:   
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Traceability matrix Verification}

\underline{Task} 

The Traceability Matrix is a resource to ensure that the project’s scope, requirements, modeling and generated code remain as are expected to be when compared to the objectives to be reached. The matrix traces the different elements by establishing a thread for each requirement to the corresponding model and component, the generated code that consists on its implementations and the test cases defined. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The specifications shall be verified following the traces between the elements defined in the matrix
\item With the matrix verification it shall be ensured that all the required information is included in the specification, such as process models and data models
\item Requirements that are not addressed by configuration items during design and code reviews can be identified; in a similar way, extra configuration items that are not required can be highlighted
\item The verification of the matrix shall provide input to change requests and future project plans when missing elements are identified
\end{itemize}

\underline{Documents to Be Produced} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Traceability Matrix Verification Report
\end{itemize}

\underline{Activities}

Taking the time to cross-reference each element involved in the project to another element ensures that the results obtained by each phase of the project are consistent with the requirements, the modeling and the code. 

To accomplish this objective it shall be verified that the traceability matrix is in the following format:

\begin{itemize}

\item The matrix generated is a two-dimensional table,
\item There is one column per identified element (such as requirement, model, components, or code),
\item A check mark at the end of the table shall be put if all the row is well traced, coherent and unambiguous
\item Various traceability matrices may be utilized throughout the project life cycle.  \item At least the matrices shall contain the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formal specification of Requirements: It shows that each requirement (obtained from SSRS) has been covered in an appropriate section of the formal specification.
\item Design specification through modeling to functional specification, this verifies that each function has been covered in the design.
\item System test plan to functional specification ensures the test case or test scenario for each process, component and each requirement in the functional specification have been identified
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The specific software tools, techniques, and methodologies to be
employed by the verification team are to be identified here.

%The structure of the Verification report is already defined in the
%\ref{sec:struct-verif-report} section of this document 

\section{Administrative Procedures}
This section identifies the existing administrative procedures that
are to be implemented as part of the Verification Plan. 
Verification efforts consist of both management and technical tasks.
Furthermore, it is the task of the SQA team to monitor whether the
procedures as defined in the management plans (\cite{QAplan}, [SCMP],
[Review and Revision processes]) are followed. 

\subsection{Problem Report}
The problem reporting procedure is described within the document
Change/Problem Management Process.

Any problem, failure and error encountered during the review
activities (QA. Verification, Validation, Assessment) planned in the
software development life-cycle, problems reported by users and
customers as well as change requests initiated by any of the system
stakeholders will be reported and managed following the Change/Problem
Management Process detailed in
\href{https://github.com/openETCS/governance/tree/master/Change-Problem%20Process}{[governance]} and through the Change/Problem Management Tool.

\subsubsection{Task Iteration Process}
Any change in the requirements (system, sub-systems, sw or components)
require repeated verification and validation activities. 

Once the change is accepted following the change/problem management
procedure, the phases and items affected by it must be
evaluated. These tests will be redesigned to reflect the change in the
requirement and will be executed again. 

In turn, a new analysis of the Software Integrity Level will involve
the analysis of the activities requirements and documentation
presented by the EN50128 standard and include such activities in the
SVVP if necessary. 

\subsubsection{Deviation Process}
The Quality Manager will be informed in the case of detection of a
deviation regarding Verification Plan. In addition, he/she also be
informed if it is deemed necessary by an amendment to the Plan,
whether or not motivated by a deviation 

The Quality Manager will report such incidents to the Project Managers
and with whom shall act appropriately. All persons listed in the
responsibilities section (Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-responsibilities}) shall be
informed of a change in the Verification Plan

\subsubsection{Control Procedure}
Control procedures are specified in the Configuration Management Plan [SCMP]






\section{Validation for a Full Development}
\label{sec:valid-full-devel}

For each of the validation steps identified in the plan
  overview, the following has to be instantiated:
\subsection{DAS2V Validation}
\label{sec:dasv-validation}

\subsubsection{Task}
\label{sec:dasv-valid-task}


\subsubsection{Documents to Be Produced}
\label{sec:dasv-valid-docum-be-prod}


\subsubsection{Phase Specific Activities}
\label{sec:dasv-valid-phase-spec-activ}

\subsubsection{Techniques and Measures}
\label{sec:dasv-valid-techniques-measures}



\subsection{SFM Validation (3d)}
\label{sec:sfm-validation}

\subsubsection{Task}
\label{sec:sfm-valid-task}

The formalisation of the requirements in form of a semi-formal model
enables a systematic check of the completeness and consistency of the
system test specification.

The model itself can perhaps be animated (depending on the concrete
form which is not yet fixed). This offers the chance to an early
(preliminary) validation of the design.

\subsubsection{Documents to Be Produced}

Testing the software against the user requirements.

\subsubsection{Techniques and Measures}
\label{sec:final-valid-techniques-measures}

\section{Implementation of \VV}
\label{sec:implementation-vv}

The \vv has to be performed in cooperation with WP~3, which
produces DAS2Vs (models and code), and with WP~7, where methods
and tools are defined and developed. 

To exchange information with WP~3, formats are needed for collecting
information about DAS2Vs (V\&V tasks) and for giving back information
about the results of V\&V activities. Similarly, with WP~7
communication shall use formats to describe V\&V methods and tools
(input from WP~7) and the results of evaluations of V\&V methods and
tools.

Besides the usual purpose of \vv activities, namely evaluating and
  proving the suitability of design artifacts, V\&V in openETCS will
  also generate information on the suitability of the methods and tools
  employed. For that purpose, a format for describing methods
  and tools to be used in V\&V and one for summarizing the findings
  about the suitability are defined.

  The plan also contains partial instantiations of V\&V which match
  partial developments that are realised within openETCS.

\section{Verification Plan for openETCS}
\label{sec:verif-plan-open}



\subsection{Verification Overview}
\label{sec:verif-overv}
 Describe the organization, schedule, resources, responsibilities, tools, techniques, and methodologies to be 
deployed in order to perform the verification activities.


\subsubsection{Organisation}
Define the relationship of verification to other efforts such as development, project management, quality assurance, and configuration management. Define the lines of communication within the verification effort, the authority for resolving issues, and the authority for approving verification deliverables.

Organisation: a format for describing design artifacts subject to V\&V,
  and a feedback format for the findings during V\&V.

\subsubsection{Schedule}
The schedule summarizes the various verification tasks
and their relationship to the overall openETCS project.
It describes the project life cycle and project milestones including completion dates.
Summarize the schedule of verification tasks and how verification results provide feedback to the whole openETCS process to support overall project management functions.
The objective of this section is to define an orderly flow of material between project activities and verification tasks.

According to the Description of Work of WP~4 \cite{WP4DoW}, the verification
activities will be structured into three main phases: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item First Level: Verification of prototypical system and API model and
  prototypical code,
\item Second Level: Verification of system model, functional API prototype model, code
  architecture and system API prototype
\item Third Level: Verification of final system and API model, final
  code and the functional API model 
\end{enumerate}







\subsection{Verification Activities---User Sories}
\label{sec:verif-activ-user}

The term ``User Story'' as used in openETCS stands for any kind
application of tools, not just for the end user application of the
system (EVC software) which is to be developed. This section shall
describe such ``user stories'' of verifiers, i.e., it
shall describe where which method or tool is to going to be applied to
what artifact(s) (DAS2Vs). It thus shall tell coherently the
\textbf{story} of verification activities. Later (sub)sections provide
the organisational detail: \textbf{When} (Timeline,
Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-activ-timel}) and \textbf{Contribution} (which of
the verification obligations from Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-full-devel} are
tackled by what approach.


\subsubsection{Reviews and Inspections}
\label{sec:reviews-inspec-openETCS}

\paragraph{Reviews}
In the openETCS project
all written documents, specifications, models and code can be
reviewed. It is also important to include all documents concerned with
the creation and delivery of the openETCS product. This means that
strategies, plans, approaches, operation and maintenance manual, user
guides, the contract that will initiate the work should all be
reviewed in a structured way. 

Information about the reviews planned within openETCS is given in the
QA plan \cite{QAplan}.

\paragraph{Inspections}
Inspection shall be applied to design artifacts whose correctness
is important for the demonstration of the project results, and also
to validate results of innovative \vv methods and/or tools.


\subsubsection{Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM)}
\label{sec:saam-openETCS}
Potential targets for SAAM are parts and instances the SFM 
(semi-formal model) of the software, to ascertain the 
viability of the software architecture decision. The scenarios 
with which the analysis shall be performed are to be developed
from the operator requirements.

\subsubsection{Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM)}	
\label{sec:atam-openETCS}
ATAM may be applied to the SW architecture.

\subsubsection{Formal Verification at Software Level}
\label{sec:form-verif-soft-openETCS}
This section describes CEA LIST's and Fraunhofer FOKUS' plans regarding the use
of formal methods to assess properties at the C code level. 
Section~\ref{sec:Frama-C} above describes the main plug-ins of the Frama-C
tool suite that are envisaged for that, while the theoretical background is
summarized in sections~\ref{sec:Abstract Interpretation}
and~\ref{sec:deduct-verif}. Namely, two main categories of properties
can be dealt with. First, we can focus on functional properties, that is
establishing that a given function is conforming to its (formal) specification.
Second, it is also possible to analyze a whole application to check the absence
of potential run-time errors (arithmetic overflows, division by 0, invalid
dereference of pointers, buffer overflow, use of uninitialized variables,
undefined order of evaluation, ...). A case study partly based on previous
experiments is developed further in OpenETCS and has been presented
in~\cite{Gerlach.2013}. Existing code from OpenETCS partners,
namely Siemens and ERSA has also been identified has a good target for
such activities.

\subsubsection{Formal Model Verification (TWT)}
\label{sec:real-time-TA-openETCS}

This section describes TWT's plans regarding the formal verification of the system model. While TWT's original approach has been focused primarily on real-time aspects by employing timed automata and the UPPAAL tool as described in Section~\ref{sct:twt:descrTA} (page
\pageref{sct:twt:descrTA}) our activities are now addressing formal model verification on a broader scale. 

TWT's work will be based on the following action items:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We will investigate the suitability of the open source toolkit CPN Tools\cite{CPNTools} for formal verfication (model checking) and simulation. The evaluation of CPN Tools will be aligned with the secondary toolchain assessment in WP7. A first step in the tool evaluation is the construction of an example model (currently ``Start of Mission'') from the ETCS specification.
  \item We will analyze whether/how UML/SysML statecharts and possibly activity diagrams can be
transformed to colored Petri nets to permit their simulation and the formal verification of requirements. 
  \item We will analyse the expressive power of the CPN Tools property language and whether the modeling formalism can replace UPPAAL for modelling and verifying timed aspects of ETCS components.
  \item We will provide feedback regarding ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors in the current ETCS standard based on our formalisation and the analysis of other models based on our approach.
  \item As the University of Braunschweig has experience with formal Petri net modelling, we will align our efforts with them.
  \item We will investigate, how our approach can be integrated in the
Eclipse environment and develop such integration if feasible with our
efforts.
  \item We plan to publish our results on action item 1.
\end{enumerate}

Please note that the above list may be subject to future change.

\subsubsection{Verification with Model-Based Simulation using SystemC (TWT, URO)}
\label{sec:model-based-sim-openETCS}

In Section~\ref{sct:uro:systemc} (page \pageref{sct:uro:systemc}) the
basics of SystemC and the SysML/SystemC joint approach have been
described. TWT and the University of Rostock (URO) will work on this
concept based on the following action items:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item TWT will analyse methods for generating SystemC code from
  SysML models. In first investigations the Acceleo tool (Eclipse
  plugin, based on OMG standard) seems to be a promising candidate for
  model-to-text transformation.
  \item URO will build a modular and executable SystemC model for
  braking curves that is suitable for real-time simulation. An
  accompanying high-level SysML model will be constructed as well and
  will be means to test the transformation methods to be developed in
  the context of action item 1.
  \item TWT and URO plan to investigate which other parts of the ETCS
  specification can benefit from real-time simulation and build models
  accordingly.
  \item URO will investigate whether performance analysis based on the
  underlying hardware system is feasible within the openETCS
  project. This will allow to scale the hardware resources of the OBU
  system accordingly.
  \item In addition, using the results from action item 1, TWT and URO
    plan to transform existing SysML models (to be developed in WP3)
    to SystemC for real-time simulation.
  \item Evaluation (and possibly implementation) of an Eclipse
  integration
\end{enumerate}

Please note that the above list may be subject to future change.

\subsubsection{System Integration  Testing (Uni Bremen/DLR)}
Section \ref{subsec:mbt} describes the main objective of system
integration testing. Uni Bremen will focus on the following items~:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a test model in SysML. From the model evaluation
  activities, the management of the radio communication is already
  available. To cover different aspect of the specification, the
  ceiling speed monitoring model will be also provided.
\item Generate test cases according to the defined interface given by
  DLR. (RT-Tester) 
\item Provide simulation environment for the
  track-to-train simulation (including braking curves/speed
  profiles)\footnote{ OpenETCS system testing for the EVC on-board
    computer requires test execution in real physical time and also
    track layout with realistic speed profiles.  We also want to
    contribute to the track and Speed Simulation by automatically
    generates ``relevant'' layout for OpenETCS.}  along routes used
  for testing
\item Study the automatic generation of these track layouts and speed
  simulations; if feasible, implement a generator and integrated it in
  the DLR laboratory environment
\item Set up a test environments for
  \begin{itemize}  
  \item Hardware-in-the-loop Testing within DLR laboratory.
  \item Software-in-loop testing with code provided by SCADE (Siemens)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Track simulation}
OpenETCS system testing for the EVC on-board computer requires test
execution in real physical time and also track layout with realistic
speed profiles.  We also want to contribute to the track and Speed
Simulation by automatically generates ``relevant'' layout for OpenETCS.


\paragraph{Test cases generation}
We also plan different activities to ensure the pertinence of our test cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Check the test model (SysML) : RTT-BMC or other model checkers
\item Add relevant LTL properties if needed
\item Test case analysis by 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Structural coverage
    \item Requirement coverage
    \item Mutation coverage 
    \item Data coverage
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Test cases analysis -- comparison to Subset 76}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide techniques and Howto describing how test cases from
  Subset 76 can be executed in the RT-Tester environment, either as SW
  integration test or as HiL test in the DLR simulation environment
\item Create new set of test cases for the ceiling speed monitoring
  (As far as we know,they do not yet exist in Subset 76)
\item Compare new test cases created by RT-Tester to new test cases
  for ceiling speed monitoring provided by ERTMS standardization
  group, as soon as available; suggest improvements for the Subset 76
  test cases. 
 \end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{Object Code Verification}
%---> please suggest something!!!

\paragraph{Exchange Formats}
Test models represented in XMI/Ecore are used as SysML test modeling
standard. RT-Tester model parsers are extended to cope with this
format.

Test procedures will be represented in a general abstract syntax
format, so that procedures generated by RT-tester can be run on any
test execution platform.

Test results (test execution logs) will be represented in a general
format, so that exchange of test results between tools (for example,
for simulation purposes) becomes possible.



A first part of these activities have already been done for model of
radio management communication (see the model-evaluation for
\href{https://github.com/openETCS/model-evaluation/blob/master/model/EA-SysML/new_version/doc/ea_sysml_report.pdf}{EA/RT-tester}). 

\subsubsection{Model Verification by applying the openETCS Verification Tool Chain (Siemens)}

Siemens will focus the activities on the verification of its contributions to the openETCS work packages 3 and 7. Currently available is the MoRC model provided for the primary tool chain for WP 7. This modeling will be continued for WP 3. The existing formal model will be complemented by a semi-formal model on top. Both, the semi-formal as well as the formal model need to be verified in WP 4 and will serve as verification objects. 

The intention is to apply the preferred and most valuable methods and parts of the openETCS verification tool chain to the models and by giving feedback into the openETCS project contribute to increase their useability and adequacy.  

In more detail, these activities are planned: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support the integration of the MoRC model into the openETCS test environment / DLR laboratory.
	\item Support the integration of the MoRC model into the RT-Tester environment, provided by Uni Bremen. 
	\item Model based test case generation and execution by using the RT-Tester environment provided by Uni Bremen. 
	\item Determination of the structural test coverage on the model.
	\item Determination of the requirements coverage regarding subset-026 documents, SSRS, implementation model, test model, test case and test execution issues.
	\item Determine the feasibility of proving safety properties for the model.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Verification Activities---Timeline}
\label{sec:verif-activ-timel}

This section lists per partner/activity in which of the project
phases according to Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-activ-timel} (first, second or
third level of verification) a particular activity is planned. In the
first version of the V\&V plan, only the first level needs to be detailed.


\subsubsection{First Level of Verification}
\label{sec:first-level-verif}

This section gives only a short description, which should refer to an activity
  detailed earlier. Most probably the material will be organised in a table.

  \paragraph{TWT}   
  TWT will continue with the analysis of methods for generating
  SystemC code from SysML models. In first investigations the Acceleo
  tool (Eclipse plugin, based on OMG standard) seems to be a promising
  candidate for model-to-text transformation. The approach will be
  aligned with URO and their SystemC model of the braking curves.  See
  also Sct.~\ref{sec:model-based-sim-openETCS}.

  In addition, TWT will start with the analysis on whether/how UML/SysML statecharts can be 
  transformed to timed automata in a sensible manner while retaining as
  much structural information as possible. Timed automata provide a means for model checking
  real-time properties of systems. See also Sct.~\ref{sec:real-time-TA-openETCS}.

  \paragraph{URO}
  URO will continue their work on a modular and executable SystemC
  model for braking curves suitable for real-time simulation. An
  accompanying high-level SysML model will be constructed as well and
  aligned with TWT's activities on SysML $\rightarrow$ SystemC code
  generation.  See also Sct.~\ref{sec:model-based-sim-openETCS}.

  \paragraph{Uni. Bremen}
  Uni Bremen will start by developing and setting a simulation
  environment for the test of the EVC. The test models from the
  model-evaluation will be completed and the breaking curves will be
  added. 
  The set of tests generated will be then compared to the available
  ones of SUBSET-076. 


\subsubsection{Second Level of Verification}
\label{sec:secon-level-verif}

\subsubsection{Third Level of Verification}
\label{sec:third-level-verif}


\subsection{Verification Activities---Process View}
\label{sec:verif-activ-proce}
This section provides the detailed plan for the verification tasks
throughout the openETCS project life cycle. It summarizes the
activities performed by the project partners in relating them to the
overall definition of verification activities in
Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-full-devel}. 

\subsection{Verification Reporting}
This section describes how the results of implementing the Verification Plan will be documented.
Verification reporting will occur throughout the software life cycle.
The content, format, and timing of all verification reports shall be specified in this section.

\nthng{\textit{This subsection has to be revised to fit the restrictions of implementability within the project.}}

The following reports will be generated during the verification process:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Anomaly reports:} 
\item \textbf{Phase Summary Verification reports:} 
\item \textbf{Final report:}
\end{itemize}

The structure of the Verification report is already defined in the
\ref{sec:struct-verif-report} section of this document 

\subsection{Administrative procedures}
This section identifies the existing administrative procedures that
are to be implemented as part of the Verification Plan. 
Verification efforts consist of both management and technical tasks.
Furthermore, it is the task of the SQA team to monitor whether the
procedures as defined in the management plans ([QAplan], [SCMP],
[Review and Revision processes]) are followed. 

\subsubsection{Problem Report}
The problem reporting procedure is described within the document Change/Problem Management Process.

Any problem, failure and error encountered during the review activities (QA. Verification, Validation, Assessment) planned in the software development life-cycle, problems reported by users and customers as well as change requests initiated by any of the system stakeholders will be reported and managed following the Change/Problem Management Process detailed in \href{https://github.com/openETCS/governance/tree/master/Change-Problem%20Process}{[governance]} and through the Change/Problem Management Tool.

\subsubsection{Task Iteration Process}
Any change in the requirements (system, sub-systems, sw or components)
require repeated verification and validation activities. 

Once the change is accepted following the change/problem management
procedure, the phases and items affected by it must be
evaluated. These tests will be redesigned to reflect the change in the
requirement and will be executed again. 

In turn, a new analysis of the Software Integrity Level will involve
the analysis of the activities requirements and documentation
presented by the EN50128 standard and include such activities in the
SVVP if necessary. 

\subsubsection{Deviation Process}
The Quality Manager will be informed in the case of detection of a
deviation regarding Verification Plan. In addition, he/she also be
informed if it is deemed necessary by an amendment to the Plan,
whether or not motivated by a deviation 

The Quality Manager will report such incidents to the Project Managers
and with whom shall act appropriately. All persons listed in the
 Responsibilities section (Sec.~\ref{sec:vv-responsibilities}) shall be informed
of a change in the Verification Plan 

\subsubsection{Control Procedure}
Control procedures are specified in the Configuration Management Plan [SCMP]

\section{Validation Plan for openETCS}

Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-overv}. 


\subsection{Validation Activities---User Sories}
\label{sec:valid-activ-user}

Like Sec.~\ref{sec:verif-activ-user}, this section describes the
validation activities to be performed within the project. It shall
tell coherently the \textbf{content} (method, tool, result quality) of
validation activities. Later (sub)sections provide the organisational

\chapter{Requirements on \VV}
\label{sec:appendix}

%\todo{Explain the requirement chapter.}
{\it
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Requirements from D2.9.
  \item Take the lists from the draft from 121207, retain the structure (at
    least preliminarily). 
  \end{itemize}
}

\section{Requirements on \VV from D2.9}
\label{sec:requirements-vv-D29}
%\todo{Adapt the intro text} 

The already provided requirements require a
safety plan compliant to the CENELEC EN~50126, 50128 and 50129.  This
pulls a number of requirements on V\&V, including Verification and
Validation plans. On the topic of compliance to EN~50128, one shall
also refer to the D2.2 document.


\reqfixed{02}{061}{A Verification plan shall be issued and complied
  with.}  
\subreqfixed{02}{061}{01}{The verification plan shall
  provide a method to demonstrate the requirements covering all the
  development artifacts.}  
\subreqfixed{02}{061}{02}{The verification
  plan shall state all verification activities required for each of
  these development artifacts.} 
 \reqfixed{02}{062}{A Validation Plan
  shall be issued and complied with.}  
\subreqfixed{02}{062}{01}{The
  validation plan shall provide a method to validate all functional
  and safety requirements over all development artifacts.}
\subreqfixed{02}{062}{02}{The validation plan shall state all
  validation activities required for each of these development
  artifacts.}

\reqfixed{01}{021}{The test plan shall comply the mandatory documents
  of the SUBSET-076, restricted to the scope of the OpenETCS project.}
\begin{justif}
  It will possibly be difficult to model all the tests in the course
  of the project, but the test plan should at least be complete.
\end{justif}


\reqfixed{02}{063}{Each design artifact needs a reference artifact
  which it implements (\emph{e.g.} code to detailed model, SFM to SSRS
  model\dots)} 

\subreqfixed{02}{063}{01}{The implementation between them relation
  shall be specified in detail.}  e.g.\ for state machine and a higher
level state machine mapping of interfaces, states and transition is
required.  This includes additional invariants, input assumptions and
further restrictions. This informaiton is the basis for verification
activities.

\subreqfixed{02}{063}{02}{The design of the artifacts shall be made
  such to allow verifiability as far as possible.}

\reqfixed{02}{064}{The findings from the verification shall be traced,
  and will be adequately addressed (taken into consideration, or
  postponed or discarded with a justification).}

    activities to be performed to ensure proper verification and that
    particular design or other verification needs are suitably
    provided for
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.4 & During development (and depending upon the size
    of the system) the plan may be sub-divided into a number of child
    documents and be added to, as the detailed needs of verification
    become clearer.
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.5 & The Software Verification Plan shall document all
    the criteria, techniques and tools to be used in the verification
    process.  The Software Verification Plan shall include techniques
    and measures chosen from Table A.5, Table A.6, Table A.7 and Table
    A.8.  The selected combination shall be justified as a set
    satisfying 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.6 & The Software Verification Plan shall describe the
    activities to be performed to ensure correctness and consistency
    with respect to the input to that phase. These include reviewing,
    testing and integration.
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.7 & In each development phase it shall be shown that
    the functional, performance and safety requirements are met.
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.8 & The results of each verification shall be
    retained in a format defined or referenced in the Software
    Verification Plan.
    \\
    \hline 6.2.4.9 & The Software Verification Plan shall address the
    following:
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item the selection of verification strategies and techniques (to
      avoid undue complexity in the assessment of the verification and
      testing, preference shall be given to the selection of
      techniques which are in themselves readily analysable);
    \item selection of techniques from Table A.5, Table A.6, Table A.7
      and Table A.8;
    \item  the selection and documentation of verification activities;  
    \item  the evaluation of verification results gained;   
    \item  the evaluation of the safety and robustness requirements;  
    \item the roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved in
      the verification process;
    \item the degree of the functional based test coverage required to
      be achieved;
    \item the structure and content of each verification step,
      especially for the Software Requirement Verification (7.2.4.22),
      Software Architecture and Design Verification (7.3.4.41,
      7.3.4.42), Software Components Verification (7.4.4.13), Software
      Source Code Verification (7.5.4.10) and Integration Verification
      (7.6.4.13) in a way that facilitates review against the Software
      Verification Plan.

\begin{description}
\item[API:] Application Programming Interface. In the project, the API defines 
the interface of the EVC software to the operating system and hardware. \textit{The
exact nature of the API still needs to be defined, whether it should be seen as
a specification or as an implementation has yet to be resolved.}
\item[ATAM:] Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method
\item [DAS2V:] Design Artifact Subject to Verification or Validation, e.g.\ 
some model or code fragment which has to be verified against its specification.
\item[EVC:] European Vital Computer
\item[FLOSS:] Free/Libre/Open Source Software
\item[FFM:] Fully Formal Model. Sometimes called ``Strictly Formal Model''. 
A model of a part of the design which has a
fully formal semantics and can thus be subjeced to rigorous analysis methods 
from the domain of mathematical or computational logic.
\item[HW:] Hardware
\item[SAAM:] Software Architecture Analysis Method 
\item[SFM:] Semi Formal Model. A model of some part of the design whose semantical
interpretation is either not fully fixed or is similar to that of a program. I.e., 
the interpretation might depend on variations in the code generation or compilation, 
or it does not resolve ``semantic variation points'' (UML).  
\item[SW:] Software
