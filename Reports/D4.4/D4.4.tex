\section{Introduction}

According to \cite[3.1.48]{EN50128:2011}, verification is an activity
to check whether the output of a development phase meets the
requirements. This concerns formalities, traceability, and, w.r.t.\
the main content, completeness, correctness and consistency. Within
openETCS, examples of each kind of verification have been
performed. Thereby, also new methods and tools have been evaluated and
adapted. 

Validation concerns the compliance of the end result of the
development with the user requirements. This has been done employing
the demonstrator of the EVC software. 

This document summarizes the activities described in more detail in
separate reports. It explains how these separate activities fit into
the development process of openETCS as defined in the deliverable
D2.3a.    

Most verification activities are actually reviews of documents (or
even programs). For general review activities, a process has been
defined in \cite{openETCS:D1.3.1}.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:lifecycle2} is an overview of the openETCS development
lifecycle, taken from D2.3a. It depicts the process for a complete
development of the EVC software, of which a part has been performed
within the project. Verification, resp., validation, has to be done in
each of the phases of the development.

\section{Overview of Verification and Validation Activities}
\label{sec:overview}


The verification and validation activities of openETCS fall in two
categories. 
\begin{itemize}
\item They may serve the purpose of supporting the development
of the EVC SW. These are activities as defined in the process
definition D2.3a, actual verification or validation of design
artifacts.
\item They may serve to demonstrate or evaluate methods or tools for
  V\&V. Such methods or tools are applied either to available design
  artifacts, or some such artifacts are created specifically for the
  purpose of the demonstration/evaluation.
\end{itemize}
Both kinds of activities are reported about in this document. It is
structured according to the phases of the development. 

\bgcmmnt{All subsubsectins:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Add references to corresponding sections
  in D4.3.1 and D4.3.2
\item Address maturity level of tools (\qq{methods too})
  \end{itemize}
 }

\subsection{Verification and Validation in the System Design Phase}
\label{sec:vnv-1}

% TWT analyzed sub-system requirements from \cite[Chapter~5]{subset-026:3.3.0}. The
% requirements have been modeled as colored Petri nets and subjected to
% formal analyses. This activity is part of the System Design
% Verification.

  operational use cases.
\item an integration of the SW on a reference hardware, applying
  operational use cases.
