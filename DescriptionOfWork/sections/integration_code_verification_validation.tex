\section{V\&V of the Implementation \& Code}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this task is to verify and validate the actual implementation of the formal model.
Therefore the tool chain from WP3\slash WP7 will be used to apply the chosen methods from
WP4 Taskr~ 1 onto the implementation of the formal model from WP3.
The chosen combination of methods and tools in WP4 Task 1 can result
in a wide variety of techniques to be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Software-in-the-Loop
\item  Model-in-the-Loop
\item  Model-based testing
\item  Static analysis (e.g. coding guidelines)
\item  Formal methods (abstract intertpretation, deductive verification, model checking)
\item  Monitoring
\end{itemize}

Analogue to WP4 Task 2 the verification and validation of the formal model
implementation is part of the development chain.
Therefore this task runs parallel to the development of the formal model in WP3, and is being applied iteratively.
Therefore feedback regarding the validity and correctness is reported to the
development process in WP3.
The results of this task are the verification and validation specifications, that is,

\begin{itemize}
\item 
how to perform the V\&V on the formal model implementation,

\item
the basic materials (the actual tests cases, checklists, etc.) and

\item
the V\&V report on the implementation of the formal model.
\end{itemize}

As first steps the relevant properties and techniques concerning the code and
implementation are to be identified. 
We list therefore the following software properties that we think are most relevant for \vv:

\begin{itemize}
\item functionality
\item robustness (absence of runtime errors)
\item performance
\item real time behaviour
\item dataflow
\item absence of deadlocks
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tbl:task43} shows the main deliverables of Task~4.3.
