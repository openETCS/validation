    doi = {10.1145/2635868.2635929},
    abstract = {A good test suite is one that detects real faults. Because the set of faults in a program is usually unknowable, this definition is not useful to practitioners who are creating test suites, nor to researchers who are creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites. In place of real faults, testing research often uses mutants, which are artificial faults -- each one a simple syntactic variation -- that are systematically seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults. Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence to support the use of mutants as a replacement for real faults. This paper investigates whether mutants are indeed a valid substitute for real faults, i.e., whether a test suite’s ability to detect mutants is correlated with its ability to detect real faults that developers have fixed. Unlike prior studies, these investigations also explicitly consider the conflating effects of code coverage on the mutant detection rate. Our experiments used 357 real faults in 5 open-source applications that comprise a total of 321,000 lines of code. Furthermore, our experiments used both developer-written and automatically-generated test suites. The results show a statistically significant correlation between mutant detection and real fault detection, independently of code coverage. The results also give concrete suggestions on how to improve mutation analysis and reveal some inherent limitations.},

    doi = {10.2168/LMCS-2(5:5)2006},
    abstract = {We consider the problem of bounded model checking ({BMC}) for linear temporal logic ({LTL}). We present several efficient encodings that have size linear in the bound. Furthermore, we show how the encodings can be extended to {LTL} with past operators ({PLTL}). The generalised encoding is still of linear size, but cannot detect minimal length counterexamples. By using the virtual unrolling technique minimal length counterexamples can be captured, however, the size of the encoding is quadratic in the specification. We also extend virtual unrolling to Buchi automata, enabling them to accept minimal length counterexamples. Our {BMC} encodings can be made incremental in order to benefit from incremental {SAT} technology. With fairly small modifications the incremental encoding can be further enhanced with a termination check, allowing us to prove properties with {BMC}. Experiments clearly show that our new encodings improve performance of {BMC} considerably, particularly in the case of the incremental encoding, and that they are very competitive for finding bugs. An analysis of the liveness-to-safety transformation reveals many similarities to the {BMC} encodings in this paper. Using the liveness-to-safety translation with {BDD}-based invariant checking results in an efficient method to find shortest counterexamples that complements the {BMC}-based approach.},

		  of a DPLL--based pseudo--Boolean SAT solver and a linear 
		  programming routine as core engine. In contrast to related tools 
		  like MathSAT, ICS, or CVC, our tool exploits all of the various 
		  optimizations that arise naturally in the bounded model checking 
		  context, e.g.~isomorphic replication of learned conflict clauses 
		  or tailored decision strategies, and extends them to the hybrid 
		  domain. We demonstrate that those optimizations are crucial to the 
		  performance of the tool.},
