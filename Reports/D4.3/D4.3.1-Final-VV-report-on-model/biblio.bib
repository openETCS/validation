	abstract = {This technical report describes the testing methodology provided for testing
systems of systems modelled with {SysML/CML.} An introductory part explains
the current state of the art and the challenges in {SoS} testing and indicates
focus points of future work. Some of these challenges will be solved within
the {COMPASS} project, as explained in the following parts of this document
and in deliverable D34.2. The {COMPASS} testing methodology is based on
the model-based testing paradigm, accepting {SysML/CML} test models as
input. It is explained how the models are transformed into an abstract syntax
tree internal to {RT-Tester.} Test cases are automatically identified by parsing
the {AST}, and requirements tracing is performed by exploiting the relations
between requirements and model elements that can be specified in {SysML}
models. Transition relations are generated from an operational interpretation
of (a subset of) {SysML/CML} models; they are used to calculate concrete
test data, using constraint solving techniques for reachability goals similar to
bounded model checking. The integration of {RT-Tester} into the {COMPASS}
tool platform and protocols supporting this objective are specified. A generic
concept for tool qualification is elaborated which conforms to {ISO26262},
{RTCA} {DO-178C} and {CENELEC} {EN} 50128-2011. This allows for applying
the testing methodology and its supporting tool platform in a safety-critical
{SoS} context},
