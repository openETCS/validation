\begin{itemize}
\item
A \emph{bit stream} is an array containing elements of type \verb"uint8_t".

A bit stream of length $n$ contains $8n$ bits.

\item
A bit stream is \emph{valid} if the array is valid.

\item 
A bit stream can be indexed both by its array indices
and its \emph{bit indices}.

Figure~\ref{fig:bitstream-indices} shows the difference between 
array indices and bit indices in a bit stream.
The two bit indices, 0~and~14,
mark bit positions in the first and second array element, respectively.

\item 
The C~programming language neither provides a type \emph{bit}
nor does it support random access to the bits of a bit stream.
In order to access the $i$-th bit of a bit sequence one typically
has to first access the byte with index $j = i/8$ and then access the 
bit $k = i \pmod{8}$ within this byte.
Note that in Figure~\ref{fig:bitstream-indices} 
bytes and bits are indexed in increasing order from the \emph{left}.
On the byte level, however, bits are often indexed from the \emph{right}.
For example, to access the $k$-th bit of a byte \inl{a} one can
shift this bit to the right by $7-k$ and extracts then the now
rightmost bit by performing a bit-wise \emph{and} with the value~1
%
\begin{verbatim}
   (a >> (7-k)) & 1
\end{verbatim}

\item
A \emph{bit sequence} is a consecutive sequence of bits within a bit stream
as represented in Figure~\ref{fig:bitsequence}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{figures/bit_sequence.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:bitsequence} A bit sequence within a bit stream}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A bit sequence is given by the position of its first bit (a bit index in the bit stream)
and its \emph{length}, that is, the number of bits it contains.

\item

A bit sequence that starts at bit index $p$ and that consists of
length $l \geq 0$ is refered to \emph{valid} (with respect to a bit stream of length $n$)
if the following conditions are satisfied
\begin{align*}
  0 &\leq p < 8n \\
  0 &\leq p + l \leq 8n
\end{align*}

Not that only the bits with indices $p \leq i < p + l$ are to be accessed
but not the bit with index~$p+l$.

\end{itemize}

We assume that the C-types \inl{unsigned int} and \inl{int}, which
are used in the implementation to represent indices, counting and error codes,
have a width of~32~bits.
We point this out here because we conducted the verification on a platform with
these characteristics.

As an aside, MISRA-C discourages the use of ``generic'' integer types
such as \inl{int} and \inl{unsigned int} and recommends the use of integer types whose names
contain the exact width.
