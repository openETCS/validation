This is in particular the case for {UML} 2.0 state machines, which are widely used for modeling the reactive behavior of objects. In this paper, a list of 29 newly detected trouble spots consisting of ambiguities, inconsistencies, and unnecessarily strong restrictions of {UML} 2.0 state machines is given and illustrated using 6 state machines having a problematic meaning; suggestions for improvement are presented. In particular, we show that the concepts of history, priority, and entry/exit points have to be reconsidered.},

	title = {Symbolic model checking without {BDDs}},
	url = {http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14},
	abstract = {Symbolic Model Checking [3, 14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. {BDDs} [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like Stålmarck's Method [16] or the Davis \& Putnam Procedure [7], can replace {BDDs.} This new technique avoids the space blow up of {BDDs}, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for {LTL} which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability. We show that bounded {LTL} model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker {BMC}, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.},
